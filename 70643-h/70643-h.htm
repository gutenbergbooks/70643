</div>


<p>I have been induced to compile this brochure, as supplementary
to the short description of Coca given in the
“Extra Pharmacopœia,” on account of the attention this
plant, and its alkaloid Cocaine, have excited during the
past eighteen months.</p>

<p>Although made known to us soon after the conquest
of Peru by Pizarro—more than three centuries ago—the
accounts travellers have given of Coca have only
received about the same credence, and been treated
with about the same reverence as we pay to a myth.
We have considered the writers as having been overcredulous,
as in some cases they undoubtedly were. It
was thought the use of the leaves by the Indians of Peru
was only that of a masticatory, which simply increased
the flow of saliva. We looked upon its so-called nutritive
properties, or rather its hunger and thirst-appeasing
effects, as well as its power to ward off fatigue and
relieve oppressive respiration during mountain ascents,
as superstitions unworthy of more attention than the
betel-nut mastication practised in India. The surgical
uses of Cocaine as a local anæsthetic have, however, to
some extent dispelled these illusions, and we have been
more ready to receive the accounts of early as well as
recent travellers, thinking “there may be something in
them.” I have endeavoured to reproduce what many
have written, as much as possible in their own words, or
translations of them.</p>

<p>The old habit of Coca chewing has clung to the
Peruvian Indians after their “power, civilisation,
language, alphabets, writings, and even old religions
have disappeared,” says Johnston,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “the common-life
customs and the bodily features of the people have
alone survived.” By him Coca is classed among the
“Narcotics we indulge in,” along with Tobacco, Hop,
Poppy and Lettuce, Indian Hemp, Areca or Betel-nut,
Ava or Kava, Red Thorn Apple (<i>Datura sanguinea</i>)
fruit, also in use among the Indians of the Andes,
Siberian Fungus or Fly Agaric (<i>Amanita muscaria</i>), and
Sweet Gale (<i>Myrica Gale</i>), formerly used to give bitterness
and strength to the fermented liquors of the ancient
Britons. But physiologists have more recently classed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
it with Tea, Coffee, Maté, Kola Nut, and Cocoa—the
Theine- (Methyl-Theobromine) and Theobromine-yielding
plants—although Cocaine has no chemical alliance
with these principles. As a beverage to substitute for
tea or coffee, a decoction or an infusion of Coca is
worthy of attention at the present time. The Indian
use of it in moderation seems to prolong life, without
much need of sleep or food, or even the desire for these,
although in excess it has, no doubt, a degrading effect.
A taste for infusion or decoction of Coca or its pharmaceutical
preparations is easily acquired; if a good sample
of leaves be used it is not even at first disagreeable.</p>

<p>As the plant admits of easy acclimatisation, and
yields annually several crops of leaves, should it come
into more extended use it is probable that its cultivation
in suitable localities in mountainous parts of India,
Ceylon, and Jamaica will prove a profitable enterprise
to planters now commencing the growth of it.</p>

<p>The text has been revised; the views of physiologists,
therapeutists, oculists, and surgeons generally have been
brought up to date; those of chemists of the constitution
of Cocaine have been epitomized, and pharmaceutical
and chemical notes have been added on the modes of
dispensing and testing the purity of Hydrochlorate of
Cocaine. Being printed in larger type than the first
edition, I trust it may be more acceptable to general
medical readers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>


<p>The medical interest which has centred in Cocaine as a
local anæsthetic during the last few years, has gradually
become diffused as “public opinion,” the more so, of
late, as it has been recommended as a remedy for sea-sickness,
from which Britons all more or less suffer on
leaving our seagirt home; otherwise, internally, Cocaine
has been but little used compared with its probably extended
use in the future, when its effects are better
known. This now important alkaloid is obtained from
the leaves of <i>Erythroxylon Coca</i>, Lamarck, a shrub cultivated
on the eastern slopes and plateaux of the Andes,
chiefly in Bolivia and Peru, but also in the Argentine
Republic, Ecuador, United States of Colombia, and
Central America, as far north as San Salvador, and
latterly in Java, Ceylon, and some parts of British India.</p>

<small>EARLY HISTORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The earliest accounts extant of Coca are contained in
the writings of the historians who treat of the Spanish
conquests in South America in the sixteenth century,
and of Spanish travellers and Jesuit missionaries who
followed in their wake.</p>

<p>Pedro de Cieza de Leon thus writes,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1532 to
1550):—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have observed in all parts of the <i>West Indies</i>,
where I have been, that the natives delight in holding
herbs, roots, or twigs of trees in their mouths. Thus, in
the territory of <i>Antiocha</i>, they use a small Herb called
<i>Coca</i>, and other sorts in the province of <i>Arma</i>. In
those of <i>Quimbaya</i> and <i>Anzerma</i>, they cut twigs off a
sort of tender middling trees, which are always green,
wherewith they are incessantly rubbing their teeth. In
most parts about <i>Cali</i> and <i>Popayan</i>, they hold in their
mouths the aforesaid small <i>Coca</i>, with a composition
they keep in little calabashes, or else a sort of earth,
like lime. Throughout all <i>Peru</i>, from the time they rise
in the morning till they go to bed at night, they are
never without this <i>Coca</i> in their mouths. The reason
some <i>Indians</i>, to whom I put the question, gave me for
so doing, was, that it made them insensible of hunger,
and added to their strength and vigour. Something
there may be in it, yet I am rather of opinion it is only
an ill habit, and fit for such people as they are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“This <i>Coca</i> is planted on the Mountains <i>Andes</i>, from
<i>Guamanga</i>, to the town of <i>La Plata</i>, where it grows up
to little trees, which they cherish and nurse up carefully,
that they may bear those leaves, resembling our Myrtle.
They dry them in the sun, and then lay them in long
narrow baskets, each of them holding about a quarter of
a hundredweight. So highly was this Coca valued in
Peru, in the years 1548, ’49, ’50, and ’51, that I believe
no plant in the world, except Spice, could equal it; for at
that time most of the plantations about <i>Cuzco</i>, <i>La Paz</i>,
and <i>La Plata</i> yielded some 80, some 60, some 40,000
pieces-of-eight a year, more or less, and all in <i>Coca</i>;
and whoever had lands assigned him first reckoned how
many baskets of <i>Coca</i> they yielded. In fine, it was more
esteemed than the best wheat. They carried it to sell
at the mines of <i>Potosi</i>; and so many fell to planting,
that it is now much fallen in the price, but will
always be valued. Several <i>Spaniards</i> got estates by
buying and selling of <i>Coca</i>, or bartering for it in the
Indian markets.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nicholas Monardes,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a Spanish physician of the sixteenth
century, also quotes Pedro de Cieza de Leon more
fully from his Commentaries “on Peruvian Things”
under the heading of Betre (Betel), “History of
Aromatics,” book i., with annotations:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This plant Coca has been celebrated for many years
among the Indians, and they sow and cultivate it with
much care and industry, because they all apply it daily
to their use and pleasure.</p>

<p>“It is indeed of the height of two outstretched arms;
its leaves somewhat like those of Myrtle, but larger and
more succulent, and green (and they have, as it were,
drawn in the middle of them another leaf of similar
shape); its fruit collected together in a cluster, which
like Myrtle fruit becomes red when ripening, and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
same size, and when quite ripe it is black in colour.
When the time of the harvest of the leaves arrives,
they are collected in baskets with other things to make
them dry, that they may be better preserved, and may
be carried to other places. For from their native
mountains they are carried to other mountainous parts
for the sake of trade, and are exchanged for other goods,
such as clothes and flocks, salt and other articles, which
stand to these people in the position of money. The
seed is enclosed in mastiche, and removed from thence
is sown elsewhere in well-cultivated earth in drills
or rows, just as we sow the pea or the bean.</p>

<p>“Its use for many purposes is common among the
Indians, for it is a necessary to them when on a journey,
and they also use it when in their homes for their
enjoyment, and in this manner—they burn the shells of
oysters and other shells, and thus make the lime into a
powder, then they grind up the Coca leaves with their
teeth, this they mix with the powder of the burnt
shells, and thus mingle both at once, but the quantity of
lime, however, must be less than the amount of leaf;
from this mass they prepare small balls or lozenges, and
expose them to dry.</p>

<p>“When they require to use these, they take one little
ball into the mouth, and suck it, turning it now this way
now that way as long as they can retain it; one being
consumed, they take another, and then a third, proceeding
thus the whole time they have need during their long
journeys, especially if they are in neighbourhoods where
neither bread nor water are plentiful, because they assert
that by this suction of these little balls their thirst is
removed, and their strength preserved.</p>

<p>“If, on the other hand, they desire to use the Coca for
the sake of enjoyment, they use it alone, turning it over
and over in the mouth, until all its properties are
exhausted, then they take more. But, if their purpose is
to be inebriated, or to be taken to some extent out of
themselves as if by mental alienation, they mix the leaves
of Coca with those of Tobacco, and chew and suck them
simultaneously; by this means they find themselves
with their reason lost to them, and are like drunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
men, and they experience thence very great pleasure.
Wonder at this matter is not wanting, when these
Indians are observed to be in this state of delight and
deprivation of mind and sense, for they do indeed use
Tobacco and Coca together for this purpose, or even
Tobacco alone, as we describe in the second volume of
this history.”</p>
</div>

<p>Augostin de Zarate<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In certain valleys, among the mountains, the heat is
marvellous, and there groweth a certain herb called
Coca, which the Indians do esteem more than gold or
silver; the leaves thereof are like unto Zumake (sumach),
the virtue of this herb found by experience is that any
man having these leaves in his mouth hath never hunger
nor thirst.”</p>
</div>

<p>Joseph Acosta,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the Jesuit, describes the use of Coca
by the natives of Peru, and says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For my part, and to say the truth, I am persuaded
that it is not pure imagination; but, on the contrary, I
hold that it gives strength and courage to the Indians;
for one sees the effect of it, which cannot be attributed
to imagination, as in travelling without food during
many days with a handful of Coca and other similar
agents.”</p>

<small>SUPERSTITIONS IN REGARD TO COCA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The employment of Coca as a masticatory goes back
to the time of the first Incas, being used in their religious
rites as an offering to the sun; the sacrificing
priest never consulted the oracles without holding some
Coca leaves in his mouth, and throwing some into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
fire which consumed the victims. It was reserved for
this use, and for that of the monarch and those who for
services rendered had become worthy of the honour of
partaking of it with their sovereign.</p>

<p>Von Tschudi<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says:—“By the Peruvian Indians the
Coca plant is regarded as something sacred and mysterious,
and it sustained an important part in the religion
of the Incas. In all ceremonies, whether religious or
warlike, it was introduced for producing smoke at the
great offerings, or as the sacrifice itself.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“During divine worship the priests chewed Coca
leaves, and unless they were supplied with them, it was
believed that the favour of the gods could not be propitiated.
It was also deemed necessary that the supplicator
for divine grace should approach the priests with
an <i>acullico</i> (or quid) in his mouth. It was believed that
any business undertaken without the benediction of Coca
leaves could not prosper, and to the shrub itself worship
was rendered. During an interval of more than three
hundred years Christianity has not been able to subdue
this deep-rooted idolatry, for everywhere we find traces
of belief in the mysterious powers of this plant. The
excavators in the mines of Cerro de Pasco throw chewed
Coca on hard veins of metal, in the belief that it softens
the ore and renders it more easy to work. The origin
of this custom is easily explained, when it is recollected
that in the time of the Incas it was believed that the
<i>Coyas</i>—the deities of metals—rendered the mountains
impenetrable if they were not propitiated by the odour
of Coca. The Indians, even at the present time, put
Coca leaves into the mouths of dead persons, to secure
to them a favourable reception on their entrance into
another world; and when a Peruvian Indian on a
journey falls in with a mummy, he, with timid reverence,
presents to it some Coca leaves as his pious offering.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reliance, Pöppig says, on its extraordinary virtues
among the Peruvian Indians is so strong that, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Huanuco Province, they believe that if a dying man can
taste a leaf placed on the tongue, it is a sure sign of his
future happiness.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>After the Spanish conquest the cultivation of Coca
much increased for a time, as described by Pedro de
Cieza and Garcilasso de la Vega, the Inca historian
(who spells its name as Cuca); the latter and Acosta
exalted its virtues, yet some fanatics proposed to proscribe
its use, and root up the plants, because it had
been used in the ancient superstitions, and its cultivation
took the Indians away from their other work. The
reverence rendered by the natives to it induced the
Spaniards to believe that it possessed some demoniacal
influence. “The second Council of Lima, consisting
of bishops from all parts of South America,” therefore
“condemned the use of Coca in 1567. It was described
‘as a worthless object, fitted for the misuse and superstition
of the Indians;’ and a royal decree of October 18,
1569, expressly declares that the notion entertained by
the natives is an illusion of the devil.” In addition,
numerous complaints were made to the home government,
who espoused the cause of the Indians, the latter
having been driven from the high Andes and employed
by forced labour in its cultivation in the Cocals, situated
on moist, warm slopes. This was a change of climate
which proved fatal to their health. The Peruvian mine
owners were the first to discover the importance of
<i>chacchar</i>, or Coca-chewing, in assisting the Indians to go
through their excessive labour, and they, together with
the plantation owners, became the most earnest defenders
of Coca. The consequence was that in defiance of royal
and ecclesiastical ordinances (like tobacco after King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
James’s “Counterblast”) its use rather increased than
diminished. One of the warmest advocates of the
plant was the Jesuit Don Antonio Julian, who, in a work
entitled “Perla de America,” laments that Coca is not
introduced into Europe instead of tea and coffee. “It
is,” he observes, “melancholy to reflect that the poor of
Europe cannot obtain this preservative against hunger
and thirst; that our working people are not supported
by this strengthening plant in their long-continued
labours.”</p>

<p>Under Don Francisco de Toledo, Viceroy of Peru, the
cultivation continued, conditionally on voluntary and
well-paid labourers only being employed in the Cocals.
At this period of its prosperity, which is much exceeded
at the present day, in the mines of Cerro de Potosi alone,
Dr. Weddell, the quinologist, says it was consumed to
the extent of one million kilogrammes (2,204,860 lbs.
Eng.) annually. But after this the culture of Coca
greatly decreased, as, owing to the hardships endured by
the Indians tending its growth and to other occupations,
their race suffered a great depopulation.</p>

<small>COCA IN LITERATURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Coca has not been official in any but the last Codex,
and last United States, British, Austrian, Belgian, and
Chilian Pharmacopœias, and although mentioned by
Guibourt and tried by Sir Robert Christison upon himself
(see p. 53), it is not mentioned by such pharmacologists
as Quincy, Pereira, or Hanbury. As a theme for the
poet, Milton, who drew many of his similes from tropical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
plants and scenery, appears not to have known of it, as
he does not mention it. Abraham Cowley, later, in his
Book V. of Plants, makes Bacchus fill Omelichilus<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> “a

ACCOUNTS OF MODERN TRAVELLERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>All the mountain Indians,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Von Tschudi states, are
addicted more or less to the practice of masticating
Coca. Each man consumes, on an average, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
an ounce and an ounce and a half per day, and on festival
days about double that quantity. The owners of mines
and plantations allow their labourers to suspend their
work three times a day for the <i>chacchar</i> or masticating
operation, which usually occupies upwards of a quarter
of an hour; and after that they smoke a paper cigar,
which they allege crowns the zest of the Coca mastication.
The Coca leaves, he says, are taken deliberately
one by one, stillness and repose being indispensable to
their full enjoyment. No urging of the traveller will
interrupt the Indian in this meal,—the servant would
leave his master if prohibited the use of Coca—he would
rather miss food. In a state of silent abstraction the
leaves are first masticated into a small ball or <i>acullico</i>, a
thin slip of damp wood is then thrust into the <i>ishcupuru</i>
or gourd, containing lime, and when drawn out, some
portion of the powder it contains adheres. The
<i>acullico</i>, or ball of masticated Coca leaves is, whilst still
lying in the mouth, punctured with this slip of wood,
until the lime mixing with it (setting free its alkaloid),
gives it a proper relish, and the abundant flow of saliva
thus excited is partly expectorated (? see Weddell, p. 19)
and partly swallowed. When the ball ceases to emit
juice, it is thrown away, and a new one is formed by the
mastication of a fresh mouthful of Coca leaves. In
Cerro de Pasco, and in places still farther south, the
Indians use instead of unslaked lime a preparation of the
pungent ashes of the Quinoa (<i>Chenopodium Quinoa</i>, L).
This preparation is called <i>Llucta</i> or <i>Llipta</i>. In using it
a piece is broken off and masticated along with the
<i>acullico</i>. In some regions the <i>Llipta</i> is made from the
musa root.</p>

<p>The Indians maintain that Coca is the best preventive
of that difficulty of respiration felt in the rapid ascents
of the Cordilleras and the Puna. “Of this fact,” says
Von Tschudi,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “I was fully convinced by my own experience.
I speak here, not of the mastication of the
leaves, but of their decoction taken as a beverage.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I was in the Puna, at the height of fourteen
thousand feet above the level of the sea, I drank always
before going out to hunt, a strong infusion of Coca leaves.
I could then, during the whole day, climb the heights
and follow the swift-footed wild animals, without experiencing
any greater difficulty of breathing than I should
have felt in similar rapid movements on the coast.
Moreover, I did not suffer from the symptoms of cerebral
excitement or uneasiness which other travellers have
experienced. The reason, perhaps, is, that I only drank
the decoction on the cold Puna, where the nervous system
is far less susceptible than in the climate of the forests
beneath. However, I always felt a sense of great satiety
after taking the Coca infusion, and I did not feel a desire
for my next meal until after the time at which I usually
took it.”</p>
</div>

<p>He also says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A cholo of Huarai, named Hatan Huamang, was
employed by me in very laborious digging. During the
five days and nights he was in my service he never
tasted any food, and took only two hours’ sleep each
night. But at intervals of two and a half or three hours
he regularly chewed about half an ounce of Coca leaves,
and he kept an <i>acullico</i> continually in his mouth. I was
constantly beside him, and therefore I had the opportunity
of closely observing him. The work for which I
engaged him being finished, he accompanied me on a two
days’ journey of twenty-three leagues across the level
heights. Though on foot, he kept up with the pace of
my mule, and halted only for the <i>chacchar</i>. On leaving
me, he declared he would willingly engage himself again
for the same amount of work, and that he would go
through it without food, if I would but allow him a
sufficient supply of coca. The village priest assured me
that this man was sixty-two years of age, and that he
had never known him to be ill in his life.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this account we cannot but conclude that the
traveller’s credulity was imposed on. He further adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Setting aside all extravagant and visionary notions
on the subject, I am clearly of opinion that the moderate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
use of Coca is not merely innoxious, but that it may even
be very conducive to health.”</p>
</div>

<p>He instances cases “by no means singular,” of
longevity among the Indians of individuals who had
attained the great age of 130 years, under its use.</p>

<p>Pöppig<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> says the average yield of a Cocal or Coca
plantation is about 800 lbs. of dry leaves per English
acre. When nearly dry, he says, they emit an odour
similar to mellilot, or the new-mown hay odour of
<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i> (probably due to coumarin),
which causes headache to strangers. If not perfectly dry
when packed they heat and ferment, and become inert
and useless, especially to the manufacturer of Cocaine.</p>

<p>Both Pöppig and Von Tschudi give a doleful account
of the intemperate use of Coca by the inveterate <i>coquero</i>,
as he is called,—his bad breath, pale lips and gums,
greenish and stumpy teeth, and an ugly black mark at
the angles of his mouth, his unsteady gait, yellow skin,
dim and sunken eyes encircled by a purple ring, his
quivering lips, and his general apathy—all bear evidence
of the baneful effects of the Coca when taken in excess.
He prefers solitude, and, when a slave to his cravings,
he will often take himself for days together to the silence
of the woods to indulge unrestrained the use of the leaf.
The habit must be very seducing, as, though long stigmatised
and very generally considered as a degrading,
purely Indian vice, many white Peruvians at Lima and
elsewhere retire daily at stated times to chew Coca.
Even Europeans, Von Tschudi says, have fallen into the
habit. Both he and Pöppig mention instances of white
<i>coqueros</i> of good Peruvian families who were addicted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the vice. One is described by Pöppig who became
averse to any exertion; city life and its restraints were
hateful to him; he lived in a miserable hut; once a
month, at least, when irresistibly seized with the passion
he would disappear into the forest and be lost for many
days, after which he would emerge sick, powerless, and
altered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He was of use to me,” he says, “as a good and eager
sportsman, and by liberally supplying him with such
fine gunpowder as he could not obtain by purchase, I
soon gained his perfect confidence and goodwill. His
disposition was generally kind, but any remonstrance
against his vice would throw him into an ungovernable
rage. He has frequently assured me in confidential
moments that he would rather, as he has done for
months together, live alone in the midst of some Coca
shrubs in the most solitary spot in the wilderness, depending
for support on his fishing-line and gun than
return home to his family at Huanuco. His description
of the lovely visions that appeared to him in the forest
at night, and of his delicious sensation at such moments,
had in it something truly awful. When it rained he used
to cover his half-naked body with the soddened leaves
that had fallen from the trees, and he assured me that
when this wretched substitute for raiment was brought to
steam by the warmth of his person, that he could lie
thus enveloped for hours without experiencing inconvenience
or cold.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such isolated cases, in some respects at least parallel,
in inveterate drunkards, are occasionally met with in
this country. <i>Coqueros</i> become afflicted with a peculiar
disease. Pöppig says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The natives of the cold and dry districts of the Andes
are more addicted to the consumption of Coca than those
of the close forests, where, undoubtedly, other stimulants
do but take its place. Weakness in the digestive organs,
... increasing continually in a greater or less degree,
first attacks the unfortunate <i>coquero</i>. This complaint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
which is called <i>opilacion</i>, may be trifling in the beginning,
but soon attains an alarming height. Then come
bilious obstructions, attended with all those thousand
painful symptoms which are so much aggravated by
tropical climate. Jaundice and derangement of the nervous
system follow, along with pains in the head, and
such prostration of strength that the patient speedily
loses all appetite; the hue of the whites assumes a leaden
colour, and a total inability to sleep ensues, which aggravates
the mental depression of the unhappy individual,
who, in spite of all his ills, cannot relinquish the use
of the herb to which he owes his sufferings, but craves
brandy in addition. The appetite becomes quite irregular,
sometimes failing altogether, and sometimes assuming
a wolfish voracity, especially for animal food. Thus
do years of misery drag on, succeeded at length by a
painful death.”</p>
</div>

<p>Later, Dr. Weddell, however, who travelled where
Coca was most in use, saw no results from its use at all
bearing comparison with these just narrated. He gives
the following interesting detailed account of the growth,
cultivation, and use of Coca from personal observation.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" >

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>


<small>DR. WEDDELL’S ACCOUNT.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cultivation of <i>Erythoxylon Coca</i>, as carried on
in Bolivia in the present day, does not appear to differ
from that which prevailed previous to the conquest;
and the province of Yungas de la Paz is that which,
since the Spanish occupation, seems to have supported
the most considerable plantations. All the slopes of the
mountains, below an elevation of 2,200 mètres [7,217
feet], are literally covered with them, and the traveller
has continually in view the factories or <i>haciendas</i> where
the leaf is prepared for the purposes of trade.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The <i>Coca</i> shrub is propagated from seed. For this
purpose the seeds, immediately after gathering, are
scattered on the surface of the light and frequently
watered soil of a little nursery (<i>almaciga</i>), where they
come up generally at the end of ten or fifteen days.
The waterings are continued, and should the sun strike
the young plants too violently, they are sheltered with
mats.</p>

<p>“The following year the shrubs, whose height is
already from 40 to 50 centimètres [16 to 20 inches] are
transplanted into a plot of ground specially prepared
for them and called a <i>cocal</i>. The arrangement of these
plantations is much more complicated than that of an
ordinary plantation, and varies according to the inclination
of the surface. When the <i>cocal</i> occupies the slope
of a mountain, which is the usual case, the cultivator
forms a series of narrow steps, each intended for a
single row of shrubs, and the more elevated (consequently
the less numerous) as the surface is more steep.
They are generally supported by little stone walls, which
serve not merely to contain the earth and prevent its
drying, but also to protect the stem and roots of the
young shrubs from the too direct influence of the solar
rays, by means of the projection which they form above
the level of the soil.</p>

<p>“Where the ground is level, they make, instead of
steps or terraces, simple furrows (<i>uachos</i>) in a straight
line, and separated from one another by little walls of
well-moulded earth, called <i>umachas</i>, at the foot of each
of which is planted a row of the shrubs, more or less
far apart from each other.</p>

<p>“At the end of a year and a half the plant affords its
first crop, and from this period to the age of forty years
or more it continues to yield a supply. Instances are
cited of <i>Coca</i> plantations which have existed for nearly
a century, and which still produce. Nevertheless, the
greatest abundance of leaves is obtained from plants of
from three to six years of age. When the trees run up
too much, the produce is less than when they spread;
they are therefore pruned in some cases to favour an
increase in breadth, which, however, is never considerable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
as the form of the shrub is irregular. The
average height of the wild plant appears to be about
2 mètres, but in cultivation it is generally allowed to
attain but 1 mètre [39 inches].</p>

<p>“The first gathering which takes place in a Coca
plantation is at the expense of only the lower leaves of
the shrubs, and it is therefore called <i>quita calzon</i>.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The
leaves of which this gathering consists are larger and
more coriaceous than those of subsequent collections,
and also have less flavour. They are mostly consumed
on the spot. All the other gatherings go by the name of
<i>mitas</i>, and take place three times, or exceptionally, four
times per annum. The most abundant harvest is that
occurring in March—that is, immediately after the rains;
this is the <i>mita de marzo</i>. The most scanty is that
which takes place at the end of June or beginning of
July, and which is called <i>mita de San Juan</i>. The
third, named <i>mita de Santos</i>, is made in October or
November.</p>

<p>“The watering of the Coca plantations greatly increases
their productiveness. Forty days are then
sufficient, I have been told, for naked shrubs to become
covered with new leaves; but these leaves are not equal
in their properties to those produced without irrigation;
their colour also is less deep, and they frequently blacken
in drying. Artificial watering is needful, moreover, only
during the dry season, and the cultivators who have the
means of employing it realise nearly always four, and
sometimes even five, crops in the year. This is particularly
the case in the districts of Irupana, where there
are facilities for obtaining water that do not exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>“I have examined the soil in which <i>Coca</i> is cultivated,
and almost everywhere have found it composed of sandy,
argillaceous earth, softish to the touch; it originates in
the decay of the schists which form the chief geological
feature of these mountains. The soil of the Coca plantation
is, in one word, formed of what we call primitive or
normal earth, but it is naturally mixed with an abundance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of angular fragments of unaltered schist which, if
not removed, would interfere with the growth of the
roots. This is therefore done by the cultivator while
preparing the furrows for the reception of the shrubs,
the stones being employed for the little walls before
spoken of; indeed, these little walls, or <i>umachas</i>, are
often formed entirely of the stones thus met with. I
need hardly say that it is to the greater or less perfection
to which this preliminary operation is carried, and to
the labours incurred subsequently in stirring up the soil
from time to time, and in keeping it free from weeds,
that the <i>haciendero</i> owes the abundance of his crops.
The last operation I have mentioned is especially needful
while the shrubs are young. The weeding, which is
regularly performed after each crop has been collected,
is called <i>mazi</i>.</p>

<p>“The collection of the leaves of the <i>Erythroxylon</i> is
performed much in the same way as that of tea. It is,
in general, women and children that are employed upon
this operation, which is all the easier from the presence
of the little walls separating the furrows of the plantation.
The gatherer squats down, and, holding with one
hand the branch she wishes to pluck, removes with
the other all the leaves, often one by one. The
leaves are deposited in a cloth, which each Indian
carries with her, and afterwards collected in sacks
or some other recipients to be carried from the
plantation.</p>

<p>“Nothing is now easier than the preparation of the
<i>Coca</i>. The leaves are carried from the plantation to the
house, or <i>casa de hacienda</i>, where they are spread out in
the sun, in little courts constructed especially for the
purpose, and the floors of which are formed of slabs of
black schist (<i>pizara</i>); if the weather is fine, they are
left there until completely dry, which takes place without
their shape becoming altered. They are then packed
with strong pressure into bags made of the sheath of the
banana leaf, strengthened with an outer covering of
coarse woollen canvas. The bales thus formed contain,
on an average, twenty-four pounds of leaves, and go by
the name of <i>cestos</i>. The <i>tambor</i> is a bale of double the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
size of the <i>cesto</i>, whose price at La Paz varies from 4½ to
6 piastres” (18s. to 24s.).<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>“The Peruvian ordinarily keeps his Coca in a little bag
called <i>chuspa</i>, which he carries suspended at his side, and
which he places in front whenever he intends to renew
his <i>chique</i>, which he does at regular intervals, even when
travelling. The Indian who prepares himself to <i>acullicar</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> to chew, in the first place sets himself as perfectly at
ease as circumstances permit. If he has a burden, he
lays it down; he seats himself; then, putting his <i>chuspa</i>
on his knees, he draws from it one by one the leaves
which are to constitute his fresh ‘quid.’ The attention
which he gives to this operation is worthy of remark.
The complaisance with which the Indian buries his hand
in the leaves of a well-filled <i>chuspa</i>, the regret he seems
to experience when the bag is nearly empty, deserve
observation; for these little points prove, as I shall have
occasion to repeat further on, that to the Indian the use
of Coca is a real source of enjoyment and not the simple
consequence of want.</p>

<p>“As the Indian deposits the leaves in his mouth he
wets them by turning them over with the tongue, forming
them into a sort of little ball, which he places against the
cheek as a sailor does his tobacco. This done, he takes
from his <i>chuspa</i> a little box which generally accompanies
the Coca, and removes from it a very small quantity of
an alkaline paste, called <i>llipta</i>, which is the ordinary
condiment to the leaf. The <i>llipta</i> which the Peruvians,
and especially the Bolivians, are in the habit of using, is
made of the ashes of the Quinoa (<i>Chenopodium Quinoa</i>)
or of those of the common <i>Cereus</i>. The ashes of several
other plants, however, are used for the same purpose,
they are often sold in the markets in the form of little
flat cakes. In some parts of America lime is substituted
for them.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
<p>“From the constancy with which the Indians employ
an alkali with the Coca, one might presume that it
favours the solution of the active matter of the leaf;
but on this head we know nothing positive. Others
have said that the <i>llipta</i> was intended to neutralise the
acid of the leaf; but it is easy to convince oneself that
the Coca contains no principle of this nature in appreciable
quantity.</p>

<p>“The leaves of the <i>Erythroxylon</i> approach in shape
and size those of tea, but they have never the dentated
margin; on the under side, a prominent and curved line
on each side of the midrib serves to distinguish them
from most other leaves known. When dried well, they
are of a very pale green, deeper on the upper than on
the under side; their odour is then agreeable, and even
analogous to that of tea. When, on the contrary, the
Coca has been dried less perfectly, this agreeable aroma
is hardly perceptible, or rather is overpowered by a pungent
odour, <i>sui generis</i>, recalling the abominable smell
exhaled by the breath of the masticators of Coca, which
is, in fact, this odour in a concentrated state. This
<i>bouquet</i>, if I may so term it, is very perceptible on
tasting the Coca, and serves, according to its abundance,
in indicating its quality. On the other hand, in a concentrated
infusion, and still more so in a decoction, it is a
bitterness mixed with something styptic that more particularly
strikes the palate.</p>

<p>“As to the immediate physiological effects of this infusion,
frequently-repeated trials enable me to assert that
they are in general limited to a slight excitement, succeeded
in most cases by some degree of sleeplessness.</p>

<p>“The questions relative to the effects resulting from
the use of Coca are less easily determined; we may begin,
nevertheless, by stating that an immense majority of
authors, both ancient and modern, who have written on
the subject, have agreed in attributing to the Coca-leaf
thus employed, virtues whose well-ascertained existence
would warrant it being placed among the more beneficial
products of the vegetable kingdom; and such
would doubtless remain the admitted opinion, had not a
modern traveller (Pöppig) completely shaken it by supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
an opposite view, that is to say, in attributing to
Coca very pernicious effects, comparable, in fact, to
those brought about by the excessive use of opium.</p>

<p>“Such assertions, in the presence of reports so opposite
as those I have cited, may well cause some astonishment.
Individuals are, however, not wanting, who give
us to understand that, if this traveller had not trusted
too implicitly to the accounts of ill-informed persons, he
had erred, at least, in too much generalising exceptional
facts. For my part, I may say, that the researches that
I have been able to make on the subject, in localities
where the Coca is most in use, have shown me that the
mastication of the leaf does sometimes produce evil
consequences among Europeans who have not accustomed
themselves to it from youth; and, in two or three
cases, I have thought I could attribute to the abuse of
this practice a peculiar aberration of the intellectual
faculties indicated by hallucinations. But, in the
countries which I have visited, on no occasion have I
seen the results to reach the point instanced by
M. Pöppig.</p>

<p>“Let us now examine what are the beneficial properties
attributable to Coca. Of these the most remarkable
is undeniably its reputed power of sustaining the
strength in the absence of any other nutriment. The
facts on which this opinion rests have been asserted by
so many credible persons, that scepticism must be
carried very far to throw over it a doubt; it appears to
me, however, that opinions may vary according to the
interpretation of the same facts.</p>

<p>“One of two things is certain, either the Coca
contains some nutritive principle which directly sustains
the strength, or it does not contain it, and therefore
simply <i>deceives</i> hunger, while acting on the system as an
excitement.</p>

<p>“As to the existence of a nutritive principle in Coca,
I am far from wishing to deny it; analysis, indeed,
shows the existence in the leaf, and especially in its
active principle, of a notable quantity of nitrogen
together with assimilable carbonised products; but the
proportion of these substances is so small compared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
with the total mass of the leaf, and especially with the
quantity of it that the Indian consumes in a given time,
that they can hardly be taken into consideration. Moreover,
I can affirm very positively that Coca, as it is
taken habitually, does <i>not</i> satiate hunger. This is a fact
of which I have convinced myself by daily experience.
The Indians who accompanied me on my journey
chewed Coca during the whole day; but, evening
arrived, they filled their stomachs like fasting men, and
I am certain I have seen one devour as much food at a
single meal as I should have consumed during two days.
The Indian of the Cordillera is like the vulture of his
mountains; when provisions abound, he gorges himself
greedily; when they are scarce, his robust nature enables
him to content himself with very little. The use of Coca
assists, it may be, to support the abstinence; but we
must have cases far more conclusive than those which I
have witnessed to convince me that it plays a part more
important than that which I attribute to it. I will, however,
add to what I have before said of the <i>llipta</i>, that
this alkaline substance may also contribute, by its direct
influence on the secretions of the stomach, to allay the
requirements of that organ.</p>

<p>“The action of Coca is then, in my opinion, confined
to an excitement, but an excitement of a peculiar kind,
which I consider as very different from that resulting
from the use of most of the ordinary excitants, and
especially of alcohol. Brandy gives strength, as all
know; but who does not know also that the ‘gift’ is but
a <i>loan</i> made out at the expense of strength reserved for
the future? The action of this agent, though powerful,
is transient. The stimulus produced by mastication of
the leaf of the <i>Erythroxylon</i> is, on the contrary, slow and
sustained, characters which it owes, doubtless, in great
part to the manner of its employment, since an infusion
of Coca acts very differently from the leaf taken in the
ordinary way. It will be said that tea and coffee, whose
effects appear to have more analogy with those of Coca,
would perhaps produce analogous results if taken in the
same manner. I do not believe such would be the case.
Tea and coffee (coffee in particular) act specially on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
brain, on which they produce an antisoporific effect, but
too well known to those who are not in their habitual
use. But Coca, while producing a little of this effect,
when taken in large doses, as I have often experienced
in my own person, does not act perceptibly upon the
brain in small doses. To account for the ordinary
effects of the leaf, one must then suppose that its action,
instead of being localised, as in the case of tea and
coffee, is diffused, and bears upon the nervous system
generally, producing upon it a sustained stimulus, well
suited to impart to those who are under its influence
that support which has been erroneously attributed to
peculiar nutritive properties.</p>

<p>“Finally, I think that in the fidelity of the Indian to
the use of Coca, as with some smokers and their pipes,
much is due to habit; and it is, I think, essential not to
lose sight of the fact, that the force of habit must have
an influence all the more powerful, since the habit in
question is almost the only one he retains of past times,
and that now, as then, he attaches to the use of the
Coca-leaf superstitious ideas, which, to his imagination,
must at least treble the greatness of the benefits he
derives from it. Lastly, that in the mastication of Coca
he finds the sole distraction that breaks the incomparable
monotony of his existence.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Weddell supposes that the word <i>Coca</i> comes from
the Aymara (Indian) <i>Khoka</i>, signifying <i>the tree</i> or
<i>plant</i>, just as the shrub producing Paraguay Tea (<i>Ilex
Paraguayensis</i>) is called <i>la Yerba</i>, i.e., <i>the plant</i>.
Botanical specimens were first sent by Joseph de Jussieu
to his brother in 1750; these Antoine Laurent de
Jussieu referred to the genus <i>Erythroxylon</i>, and finally
they served as types for Lamarck to give the plant his
designation, <i>Erythroxylon Coca</i>, in the <i>Encyclopédie
Méthodique</i>.</p>

<small>SCHERZER, FUENTES, AND OTHERS, ON COCA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carl Scherzer, who brought the supplies to Europe
from which Niemann and Lossen, under Wöhler, first
isolated Cocaine, narrates the following:<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Scotchman named Campbell, who was settled as a
merchant at Tacna in Bolivia, and with whom I travelled
to Europe from Lima, informed me that a few years
before, being engaged upon matters of urgent business,
he had performed in one day a distance of 90 English
miles on mule-back, and throughout that long distance
had been accompanied by an Aymara Indian, who kept
up easily with the mule, without other refreshment than
a few grains of roasted maize and Coca leaves, which,
mingled with undissolved chalk (? slaked lime), he chewed
incessantly. On reaching the station where he had to
pass the night, Mr. Campbell, though mounted on an
excellent animal, found himself greatly fatigued; the
guide, on the other hand, after he had stood on his head
for a few minutes,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and had drunk a glass of brandy, set
off without further delay on his homeward journey!</p>

<p>“In April, 1859, Mr. Campbell despatched a native
from La Paz to Tacna, a distance of 249 English miles,
which the Indian accomplished in four days. He rested
one day at Tacna, and set off the following morning on
his return journey, in the course of which he had to
cross a path 13,000 feet in height. It would seem that,
throughout the whole of this immense journey on foot, he
followed the Indian custom of taking no other sustenance
than a little roasted maize and Coca leaves, which he
carried in a little pouch at his side, and chewed from
time to time.</p>

<p>“The mail goes four times a month from La Paz to
Tacna, and usually weighs 25 lb., which the courier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
carries on his back, and delivers within some five or six
days, without other nourishment than that already
specified.”</p>
</div>

<p>According to Senor Fuentes,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> “the incontestable facts
which experience affords as to the virtues of Coca may
be divided into two classes, those relating to healthy
persons, and those concerning ailing or sickly individuals.
It has been admitted that the Indians of the
mountains, who, among the natives of Peru, are most
given to the use of Coca, are these who endure the
hardest labour, such as:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Mining operations. The mines are almost all
situated in the coldest parts of the Cordilleras. There
the Indians work night and day, the pickaxe or the
shovel in their hand, to detach the minerals, which they
carry on their shoulders through long and deep subterranean
passages, or they stamp with their feet masses of
mineral from which they have to extract the metal. All
the rest they get during this incessant toil is to lie down,
turn by turn, on a skin covered with a poncho to snatch
a few moments of repose, and to chew their portion of
Coca leaf.</p>

<p>“2. The postal service. Bearing a case of letters on
their shoulders, they may be seen undertaking with
celerity journeys of hundreds of miles, traversing, to
shorten their route, deserts and rugged Cordilleras.
These unfortunate Indians suffer from all the injuries of
the rarefied air, which exercises a most severe effect on
a half-naked man, obliged to traverse the rocks and
deserts of the sierras or mountainous regions. His only
shelter and chance of repose, when snow-storms surprise
him or fatigue overcomes him, is to take refuge in some
cavern or under some projection of rock, where, reclining
on the frozen ground, he snatches a few hours of
sleep.</p>

<p>“3. The occupation of shepherd. The Indian
generally pastures his wool-bearing animals of the alpaca
tribe on the bleak pampas, which produce scarcely anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
but a coarse kind of grass, called locally ‘hichu.’
The rigour of the climate renders these mountain shepherds
as black as Ethiopians.</p>

<p>“4. Irrigation. When the Indians are obliged to water
their fields during the night, in the middle of the rigours
of winter, and on the most elevated plateaux, they are
often many hours knee-deep in water, and exposed like
their comrades to the cutting blast of a cold and penetrating
wind.</p>

<p>“For resisting all these fatigues and the inclemencies
of the seasons, the Indians have no other food than a
handful of maize, a few potatoes, and their pouch of
Coca leaves. They never eat flesh unless it is given
them, which is rarely, as they respect the lives of their
flocks as their own.</p>

<p>“Dr. Ignacio Flores having seen an Indian of the
tribe of the Canaris, who was employed in the postal
service between Chuquisaca and La Paz in Bolivia, that
is a distance of over 100 leagues, with no other provision
with him than a few grains of roasted maize, a few cakes
of chuno, or frost-dried potatoes, not weighing together
two pounds, and his bag of Coca leaves, declared that
there was not a monk or hermit in the world so austere
or abstinent. This frugality, and this hardihood to
fatigue, the very recital of which makes one shudder,
have been attributed by many not to the use of Coca, but
to the training and education, as it were, of the Indians.
This assertion, however, may be easily rejected by
having regard to the following facts:—</p>

<p>“1. The Indian has naturally a voracious appetite
whenever he is brought into contact with any one
generous enough to feed him.</p>

<p>“2. A great many Spaniards, who could not support
the labour of the mines and the inclemency of the Cordillera,
having taken to the regular use of Coca, have
forthwith acquired the Herculean force of the Indians.</p>

<p>“3. When the natives give up the use of Coca, and
change their ordinary food system, they lose that ancient
vigour and power which enabled them to resist fatigue
and the inclemency of the weather.</p>

<p>“4. Notwithstanding the rigorous prevention of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
use of Coca in Tucuman, the habit of chewing the leaf
is clandestinely practised, because it is alone found to
give to the muleteers the power of resisting the rigours
of the icy plateaux of Lipes, and of prolonged night
watches to prevent the mules they are transporting to
Peru from straying.</p>

<p>“5. During the prolonged siege which the rebel Indians
carried on in 1781 against the town of La Paz in
Bolivia, the inhabitants had no other food left than
leather, unclean animals, &amp;c., and having to watch at
night in the trenches during a rigorous winter to repulse
the attacks of the Indians, a great many took to the use
of Coca, as the only means of averting this horrible
famine.</p>

<p>“Passing now to the beneficial effects of Coca on the
sick and invalid, facts which, Senor Fuentes asserts,
experience has confirmed; it is said to strengthen the
gums and preserve the teeth. Taken in the form of an
infusion, like tea, it excites perspiration and soothes those
who suffer from asthma. Taken either in infusion or
chewed, it assists the functions of the stomach, removes
obstructions, and cures gripes or colic. Applied
externally in friction or plasters, it allays rheumatic
pains caused by the cold.</p>

<p>“Our author further asserts that it cures intermittent
fevers in the dose of a teaspoonful of sulphate of
cocaine(?), and is a protection against syphilis. This last
allegation is probable, seeing that an Indian is rarely
met with afflicted with venereal diseases, so common
among whites and negroes.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Western Brazil a preparation of the Coca leaf in
powder is known as Ypadú or Ipadú. Martius says<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
“the powder of the dried leaves is notable from its
wonderful effect on the nervous system, especially on the
brain, as has been lately observed, and it should be received
into the treasures of materia medica.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p>By R. Spruce,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Ipadú is described as he saw it used
on the banks of the Rio Negro, an affluent of the
Amazon; the powdered roasted(?) Coca leaves are mixed
with a little tapioca and the ashes of Imbaúba (<i>Cecropia
peltata</i>, &amp;c.). He says:—“With a chew of Ipadú in his
cheek an Indian will go two or three days” without food,
and without “having any feeling or desire to sleep.”</p>

<p>The “quid of Coca” is frequently mentioned by
Squier,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a recent American traveller in Peru, but he
gives no details of its cultivation or use.</p>

<p>Fitzroy Cole<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> also describes the use of Coca in terms
similar to those of Weddell, but he confounds it with
<i>Theobroma Cacao</i>, which yields Cocoa. He says:—“The
incredible fatigue endured by the Peruvian infantry on
very spare diet, but with the regular use of Coca, the
laborious toil of the Indian miner under similar circumstances
throughout a long series of years, certainly afford
sufficient ground for attributing to these Coca leaves the
quality, not only of a temporary stimulant, but also of a
strong nutritive principle.”</p>

<small>THE CULTIVATION OF COCA.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The most recent account of the cultivation of Coca is
given by Henry H. Rusby, M.D., who, for more than
two months, was engaged in the study of the Coca plant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and its products in the districts of Bolivia which produce
the best quality of leaves. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the details concerning cultivation here presented
I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Oscar Lohse, one of the
most intelligent cultivators in this country, and proprietor
of the Finca of San Antonio, two leagues from
the town of Caroica, Yungas.</p>

<p>“The district of Caroica may be considered as fitly
representing the remainder of Yungas, and Yungas as
representing the principal Coca districts of this republic.
The conditions of soil and climate may be briefly stated.
Proceeding eastward from La Paz, itself somewhat more
than ten thousand feet<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> above the sea, for a distance
of four or five leagues, we reach the summit of the
pass over the easternmost cordillera of the Andes,
this cordillera having an average elevation in this
immediate district of perhaps sixteen thousand feet.
This ridge, always more or less snow-covered, cuts off a
large portion of the westward-bound clouds, which are
either precipitated in the form of rain before reaching
the summit, or arriving there, are deposited in the form
of snow, and then returned by means of rivulets to the
valleys, chiefly of the eastern slope. It should be noted
that in Northern Peru and Ecuador this cordillera is
higher than here, so that the eastern slope in those
regions is more profusely and regularly watered than here.
From this pass, had we a direct road, we could travel in
half a day, so steep is the descent, to the banks of the
Caroica River, having an altitude of only two thousand
four hundred feet. When we have descended to six
thousand four hundred feet we should meet with our first
Coca plantations, and after passing the two thousand foot
level we should have left them principally or entirely
behind. Within this four or five thousand feet, then, lie
the cocales of Bolivia. No description can convey a
perfect idea of the steepness of this luxuriant slope.
Travel, entirely by riding-animals, is extremely difficult.
There are only occasional places where we can readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
leave the road, and here plantations are established.
The hedge of coffee-plants at the roadside proves on examination
to be the uppermost row of a plantation; and
as we peer down among the shrubs we marvel that anyone
can preserve his footing while cultivating or collecting
the coffee. The scenery is, of course, magnificent, and
of a different type, I should think, from that of any other
part of the world. The mountains are too young to have
lost to a great extent their ragged outline, yet softness is
imparted by the richness of the vegetation. We stand
among the coca plants and distinctly see another cocal
nearly four thousand feet below us.</p>

<p>“The cultivated plants of the coca district are coffee,
rice, cacao, sugar cane, tobacco, maize, cotton (the
arborescent species), sweet potatoes, yuccas, and the
ordinary garden vegetables. The principal fruits are
oranges, bananas, cocoanuts, lemons (sweet and sour),
citrons, grapes, chirimoyas, alligator pears, tumbas,
pomegranates, grenadillas, figs, papayas, lukmas, melons,
and pineapples, the last just introduced.</p>

<p>“The soil in such a broken country is, of course, very
diversified, ranging from a very light decomposed shale
or sandstone to a heavy blue or chiefly yellow clay.</p>

<p>“The rainy season begins in October, and continues
until May or June. During this time the rains are
copious and almost constant. During the succeeding
two months there is scarcely a drop of rain, and during
the next two there are only occasional showers.</p>

<p>“Such are the conditions under which the Coca grows
in this section.</p>

<p>“When we come now to consider the methods of
cultivation here adopted, we must be cautious about
accepting them as the best, merely because they are
generally followed here. It is to be remembered that
the Bolivian system of agriculture has not received the
attention that it should have had, and that it is very
probable that reforms might be introduced in present
methods.</p>

<p>“Nor is it proper to proceed concerning Coca-culture
without a few words concerning what is meant by the
‘best quality’ of Coca-leaves. To a manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
chemist the best quality would mean the quality that
would yield the largest percentage of crystallizable
cocaine, obtainable in the easiest manner, while the
same Coca might be considered for domestic consumption
as representing one of the lower grades. It is
highly probable that the amount of cocaine forms no
element in the Indian’s estimate of the quality of Coca,
no more than the percentage of nicotine establishes the
quality of a particular grade of tobacco. Coca-leaves
are classed in general by the Indians as ‘hajas dulces’
(sweet leaves) and ‘hajas amargas’ (bitter leaves). The
former are made sweet by the abundance of alkaloids
other than cocaine. While it is true that a greater
abundance of these alkaloids is usually accompanied by
a larger percentage of cocaine also, yet the variation in
the amount of the latter is not so great as in the former;
so that while in the sweet leaves the bitter taste of the
cocaine is masked by the presence of the other alkaloids,
in the bitter leaves its flavour is the predominant one.
The presence, then, of these <i>sweet alkaloids</i>, as we may
call them, translating the simple and expressive term of
the Indians, determines the domestic value of the Coca,
and all that is known of the best methods of cultivation
is based on the production of the highest percentage of
these alkaloids.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Experience may determine that for
manufacturing purposes a very different line of principles
of culture should be followed.</p>

<p>“I have made a large number of assays tending
towards elevations, soils, exposures, seasons, ages of
plants, and of leaves, different varieties, wild and
domestic, different parts of the plant, and various modes
of drying and packing. The results will be embodied
in a future monograph, mere passing references being
made to them for the present. I have about concluded
that the percentage of the sweet alkaloids varies inversely
as the amount and continuousness of moisture that the
plant receives. Thus, the Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and
Brazilian Coca, which, as I have stated, is much more
copiously and regularly watered than the Bolivian, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
markedly inferior, so that Bolivia regularly exports about
one-eighth of her crop to those countries. I am inclined
to think that the greater breadth and thinness of the
northern leaf may be partly due to the greater water-supply
and the consequent greater degree of evaporation.
Again, the Indian always seeks the Coca grown at the
higher elevations, where the humidity is much less and
more irregular than in the districts along the rivers. We
are thus obliged, for reasons to be elaborated in the
future, to regard these alkaloids as preserving a sort of a
balance of moisture, by which the plant stores up during
the wet weather a concentrated supply of water, which
may be very slowly yielded up during a time of need.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having thus chosen a high altitude, the next thing
is to select a soil. A rivalry exists between a yellow clay
and a hill-side soil rich in vegetable matter. My assays
have yielded the best results (as to total alkaloids) from
soils of the latter class, and I am inclined to think that
those who prefer the former soil do so because it yields
a somewhat larger crop.</p>

<p>“The ground for the nursery-bed is prepared during
the latter part of the dry season by breaking it up very
thoroughly to the depth of a foot or more. The fruits
mature during the early part of the rainy season,
December and January. They are red, and consist of a
fleshy outer portion and a shell-like inner portion, which
encloses the single seed. These people suppose that
the germ cannot escape from the shell if planted in its
natural condition, and they have continued for hundreds
of years to deposit the seeds as soon as gathered in a
shaded place, in layers an inch or more deep, and
covered with a thin layer of decaying leaves, or similar
substance. The heat generated by the decomposition
of the fleshy pericarp serves to induce germination, and
the embryo bursts from its bony covering. This growth
unites them in from eight to fourteen days into a solid
mass, which is broken up into small pieces and planted
in furrows in the nursery. In this process very many of
the sprouts are broken off and the plants destroyed. Mr.
Lohse has adopted the plan of sowing the seeds broadcast
as soon as gathered, and covering with a little earth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
or, better, a layer of banana leaves or decaying vegetable
matter. Germination requires from eight to twelve days
longer, but all the plants are saved. In either case, a
covering of brush or straw must be placed over the
nursery, at first only three or four inches above the
surface, and elevated to six or seven inches, as the
plants grow. Usually this elevation is repeated once
more.</p>

<p>“All this taking place during the rainy season, the
plants have reached a good size before the advent of the
dry weather, and so do not call for any artificial water-supply.
Advantage is taken of the ensuing dry season
to clear the land and prepare the ground for the new
cocal. On the manner in which this is done depends
much of the future well-being of the plants. The ground
should be thoroughly powdered to the depth of two, and,
if possible, three feet, all roots and large stones being
removed. On these steep slopes it is necessary to terrace,
the terraces being supported by stone walls, the stones
laid dry. The width of the terraces, according to the
slope, varies from several feet, with a number of rows of
plants, to much less than the height of the wall, only a
single row of plants being admissible. It is here
generally believed that shade tends to the production
of the best quality of leaves; so the cocales are
planted thickly with a small broad-topped leguminous
tree related to the St. John’s bread, but whose name I
cannot at this moment recall. There is no doubt that
this is a mistake. I have made repeated comparative
assays of shade-grown and sun-grown leaves from
adjoining plants, and invariably found the latter much
richer in total alkaloids. I judge the custom to have
arisen from two considerations. There is, as I have
stated, a period of two or three months when the plants
receive no rain, and then these trees afford a protection
from the fierce heat. Secondly, shade conduces to the
production of a large, smooth, beautiful leaf, of elegant
colour, and thus adds to the <i>appearance</i> of the product.
The terraces being thus prepared, on the advent of the
permanent rainy season, the plants, now from 8 to 12
inches high, are transplanted, being set from one-half to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
six inches apart, according to the ideas of the haciendero.
From this time until the first leaves are picked, the
greatest care must be taken to keep the soil thoroughly
stirred and free from weeds. The plants having been
transferred in October or November of one year, the
first picking is made in March or April of the second
following year, one year and a half from the time of
transplanting, or two and one-half from the seeds. In
case an insufficient space has been prepared, the remaining
plants are often left until the following year, and
then transplanted, the operation being much more
dangerous to the life of the plants.</p>

<p>“The chief danger of picking the leaves earlier than
the period indicated above is not the strain upon the
vitality of the young plant, as many of the leaves drop
off themselves, but because it is almost impossible to
avoid breaking off the very tender tips of the twigs, the
result being fatal to many plants. Immediately after
this first picking, fresh leaves develop with great rapidity,
and in July or August of the same year the plant flowers
for the first time. The lovely white flowers, if undisturbed,
remain from three to six days; but from the very
first they are dislodged by the slightest jar, the corolla
falling entire, although it is morphologically polypetalous.
The fruit ripens in December and January.</p>

<p>“During the first few years the percentage of alkaloid
increases rapidly, reaching its maximum at or before the
age of ten years. At the age of twenty it begins to
diminish, but with extreme slowness, so that the plants
are practically in their prime up to the age of thirty-five
or forty. It is probable that the decline is then due
rather to the exhaustion of the soil than of the vitality
of the plant. Fertilisation of the soil has never been
resorted to. It is probable, as suggested by Mr. Lohse,
that as much can be done for the Coca in this way as has
been done for other plants.</p>

<p>“A Coca harvest is called a <i>mita</i>, an Indian word
meaning a division or drawing of lots, and there are from
three to five in a year, according to the season. The
time of picking is determined solely by the condition of
the leaves. When they have become mature they turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
yellow if in the dry season, and brown if in the rainy,
and within eight days at the outside will fall to the
ground and be lost. As soon as the mita is over, the
ground is cleared from weeds, and, under an ignorant
notion that further cleaning is injurious, is left undisturbed
until after the next mita. But Mr. Lohse has
tried the plan of keeping the ground clean, with the
result, thus far, of receiving the next crop in little more
than one-half the time required by his neighbours. No
irrigation is resorted to during the dry season. Although
it is possible that good might result, at least to the
welfare of the plant and the size of the crop, I suspect
that after a long time an abundant and steady supply of
water would result in a decrease in the amount of alkaloids.
Mr. Lohse has tried the experiment of mulching
at the end of the wet season with a few inches of banana leaves
or other refuse, with excellent effect upon the
plants during the succeeding dry season.</p>

<p>“This plant is subject to only two diseases of any
importance. The first is taja, which I suppose to be the
result of a fungus which attacks the undeveloped leaves
and tender twigs. It is said by some to be caused by
careless picking, in which the twigs are broken. By
others it is said to result from the planting of seeds
taken from young plants. The only remedy is to remove
and burn the diseased portions. The second
disease, if such it can be called, is the ravages of a
caterpillar called “ulo,” which makes its appearance in
December, and destroys the crop so quickly that it
admits of no remedy.</p>

<p>“The method of picking and drying the Coca has
been so often and so well described of late that it is not
necessary to dwell upon it. Coca picking is a profession
to which the children are trained from a tender age.
The leaves are picked singly, both hands being employed
with a rapid alternating motion, which strips a
twig in an instant. Great care is taken to avoid breaking
the twigs, and the young leaves are not picked.
Little sacks are tied about the waist, or the women’s
aprons are pinned or sewn into the required form. They
are then transferred to larger sacks, which must be filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and emptied with great promptness, or the leaves will
become heated and turn black.</p>

<p>“The price here paid for picking is a Bolivian dollar,
equal to about seventy-one cents United States currency,
or three shillings English, for each thirty pounds,
which, when dry, will weigh about twelve pounds.</p>

<p>“The leaves are exposed to a hot sun upon a pavement
of nicely-fitted flat stones, and stirred occasionally
until dry. Under the most favourable conditions the
drying is accomplished in about three hours. About
the Coca place are built the storage and packing sheds.
These are furnished with very broad doors, and men are
in constant attendance to sweep the Coca with brush-brooms
through these broad portals at the slightest
indication of rain. A very few drops of rain are sufficient
to decolorise and ruin the sale of the Coca,
though it is my impression that such decolorisation, if
produced by but little rain, is no indication of loss of
cocaine. During the first few days that the dry Coca
lies within the storage-sheds it undergoes a slight
sweating process.</p>

<p>“When I come now to speak of the best methods of
packing the Coca for export, it is fair to say that nothing
definite is known. Such Coca as has reached Europe
or the United States in good condition has done so
purely by accident; for, perhaps, the very next lot, dried,
packed, and shipped as nearly as possible in the same
manner, has arrived entirely ruined. I have tried many
methods, and as often as I had thought that the secret
was discovered, my hopes have resulted in disappointment.</p>

<p>“As regards the exportation of the culture of Coca,
the experiment has been tried, I believe, but once.
Several years since, Mr. F. L. Steinart, of La Paz, shipped
a small quantity of seeds <i>viâ</i> London to Ceylon, and
during the past season the first products were shipped
to London and sold at a high price. Seeds for export
should be exposed for several days to a hot sun, so as
to rapidly dry the fleshy exterior, which thus forms a
protection to the germ within.</p>

<p>“It is my opinion that the Coca-plant is adapted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
culture in many countries where it is now unknown.
Among the countries where it would be well to experiment
with it are Guatemala, Mexico, the East and West
Indies, India, Southern China, portions of Africa, and
possibly of Italy. It is doubtful if it would grow in
any portion of the United States. Requiring an average
temperature of at least 70°, the only districts at all
suited would be Florida and Southern Texas; and it is
highly probable that proximity to the sea-coast at so low
an altitude would prove fatal. Nor would irrigation
prove adequate in those countries possessing a long dry
season. The plants must not only have an abundant
supply of water at the roots; they must be bathed in a
humid atmosphere for the greater portion of the year.
But from what I have read of some of the countries
above named, I am confident that the plant would there
find a congenial home. Jamaica offers especially hopeful
conditions.”</p>

<small>DR. MANTEGAZZA’S EXPERIMENTS WITH COCA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Dr. Paolo Mantegazza, of Milan, who practised for
many years in South America, thus writes of Coca:—<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Erythroxylon Coca, a plant which grows in
moist and woody regions on the eastern slopes of the
Andes, is highly valued by the inhabitants of Peru,
Chili, and Bolivia, not only as a medicine, but also as
an article of food; and serves with them as a substitute
for the tea, coffee, betel, tobacco, haschisch, and
opium used by other nations. Its culture, upon which,
since the time of Pizarro’s conquest, much care has
been bestowed, has recently increased to such a degree,
that in the year 1856 the revenue of the Republic of
Bolivia, from the sale of this herb, amounted to thirteen
millions of francs—a very large sum if compared with
the small number of consumers (800,000). According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
to the account of M. Pöppig and of other well known
travellers, the natives use the dried leaves of the Coca-plant
either by themselves or in combination with a
highly-alkaline substance called <i>llipta</i>, which is prepared
from roasted potatoes and the ashes of different other
plants; they masticate them like the Malays and the
inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago do the calcined
leaves of the <i>Chavica Betle</i>. The use of this masticatory,
which is considered a great delicacy, is not, however,
confined to the rich; on the contrary, it is particularly
among the hard-working Indians that the Coca enjoys
a high reputation as a nutriment and restorative, and
its use is considered absolutely essential for the endurance
of fatigue and exertion, so that a labourer, in
making his contract, has a view not only to wages, but
to the amount of Coca to be furnished. The Inca, who
lives at a height of seven to fifteen thousand feet above
the level of the sea, and whose meagre fare consists
principally of maize, some dried meat, and potatoes of
bad quality, believes that he can sustain his strength
solely by the use of Coca; the porter, who carries the
mail, and accompanies the traveller over the roughest
roads at the quick pace of the mule, invigorates and
strengthens himself by chewing Coca; the Indian, who
works half-naked in the silver and quicksilver mines,
looks upon this plant as an ambrosia capable of imparting
new life, and of stimulating to new exertions. It is
not surprising, under such circumstances, that this article
should be very much abused, and that the evil of intemperance
in the use of Coca, known as coquear,
should be quite as prevailing among the natives of
those districts as intemperance in the use of tobacco,
alcoholic liquors, and opium is among other nations.
They intoxicate themselves for several weeks, hide in
the deepest forests in order not to be disturbed in their
enjoyment, and not rarely return home to their family
suffering from delirium or decided idiocy.”</p>

<p>‘Be it that the praised efficacy of the plant is merely
the effect of fancy or tradition, or that the plant really
contains a powerful principle unknown to science, the
solution of this mystery is certainly a worthy theme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
for scientific enquiry, and the investigations of Dr.
Mantegazza deserve, therefore, our full attention.</p>

<p>‘The child and the feeble old man seize with equal
eagerness the leaves of the wonderful herb, and find in
it indemnification for all suffering and misery.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Mantegazza observed that the chewing of a
drachm of the leaves of the Coca increased salivation,
giving at first a somewhat bitter, and afterwards an
aromatic, taste in the mouth, and a feeling of comfort in
the stomach, as after a frugal meal eaten with good
appetite. After a second and third dose, a slight burning
sensation in the mouth and pharynx, and an increase
of thirst were noticed; digestion seemed to be more
rapidly performed, and the fæces lost their stercoraceous
smell, the peculiar odour of the juice of the Coca becoming
perceptible in them. On using the Coca for
several days, the author observed on himself as well as
on other individuals a circumscribed erythema, an eruption
around the eyelids resembling pityriasis; from time
to time a not unpleasant pricking and itching of the skin
was felt. An infusion of the leaves, taken internally,
was found to increase the frequency of the pulse in a
considerable degree. In making observations on the
frequency of the pulse, the author was very careful to
consider all the conditions which might influence it; he
found that, the temperature of the air being the same
and the liquids being heated to an equal degree, an infusion
of Coca will increase the action of the heart four
times its normal standard, while cocoa, tea, coffee, and
warm water only double it. By taking an infusion prepared
from three drachms of the leaves a feverish condition
was produced, with increased heat of the skin,
palpitation of the heart, seeing of flashes, headache, and
vertigo; the pulse rose from seventy to one hundred and
thirty-four. A peculiar roaring noise in the ear, a desire
to run about at large, and an apparent enlargement of
the intellectual horizon indicated that the specific influence
upon the brain had commenced. A peculiar, hardly
describable feeling of increased strength, agility, and
impulse to exertion follows; it is the first symptom of
the intoxication, which is, however, quite different from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the exaltation produced by alcoholics. While the latter
manifests itself by increased but irregular action of the
muscles, the individual intoxicated by Coca feels but a
gradually-augmented vigour, and a desire to spend this
newly-acquired strength in active labour. After some
time the intellectual sphere participates in this general
exaltation, while the sensibility seems to be hardly influenced;
the effect is thus quite different from that
produced by coffee, and resembles in some degree that
of opium. Dr. Mantegazza could, in this excited condition,
write with ease and regularity. After he had
taken four drachms he was seized with the peculiar feeling
of being isolated from the external world, and with
an irresistible inclination to gymnastic exercise, so that
he, who in his normal condition carefully avoided the
latter, jumped with ease upon the writing-table without
breaking the lamp or other objects upon it. After this
a state of torpidity came on, accompanied by a feeling
of intense comfort, consciousness being all the time perfectly
clear, and by an instinctive wish not to move a
limb during the whole day, not even a finger. During
this sensation sleep sets in, attended by odd and rapidly-changing
dreams; it may last a whole day without
leaving a feeling of debility or indisposition of any kind.
The author increased the dose to eighteen drachms in
one day; his pulse rose in consequence of it to one
hundred and thirty-four, and, in the moment when
delirium was most intense, he described his feelings to
several of his colleagues, who observed him, in the
following written words: ‘<i>Iddio è ingiusto perche ho
fatto l’uomo incapace di poter vivere sempre cocheando</i>’
(this is the expression for intoxication by Coca). ‘<i>Io
preferiscto una vita di 10 anni con Coca che un di
1,000,000 secoli senza Coca.</i>’ After three hours of sleep
Dr. Mantegazza recovered completely from this intoxication,
and could immediately follow his daily occupation
without the least indisposition—on the contrary, even
with unusual facility. He had abstained for forty hours
from food of any kind, and the meals then taken were
very well digested. From this fact, the author finds it
explainable that the Indians employed as carriers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
mail are able to do without food for three to four days,
provided they are sufficiently supplied with Coca.</p>

<p>‘From these experiments, made repeatedly on himself
and on other individuals, Dr. Mantegazza draws the
following conclusions:—</p>

<p>‘1. The leaves of the Coca, chewed or taken in a weak
infusion, have a stimulating effect upon the nerves of the
stomach, and thereby facilitate digestion very much.
2. In a large dose Coca increases the animal heat and
augments the frequency of the pulse, and consequently
of respiration. 3. In a medium dose (three to four
drachms), it excites the nervous system in such a manner
that the movements of the muscles are made with greater
ease; then it produces a calming effect. 4. Used in a
large dose, it causes delirium, hallucinations, and finally
congestion of the brain.</p>

<p>‘The most prominent property of Coca, which is
hardly to be found in any other remedy, consists in
the exalting effect it produces, calling out the power of
the organism without leaving afterwards any sign of
debility. The Coca is in this respect one of the most
powerful nervines and analeptics. These experiments,
as well as the circumstance that the natives have used
the Coca from the earliest period as a remedy in
dyspepsia, flatulency, and colic, have induced Dr.
Mantegazza, and several of his colleagues, in South
America and Europe, to employ the leaves of the Coca
in a variety of cases, partly as masticatory, partly in
powder, as infusion, as alcoholico-aqueous extract in the
dose of ten to fifteen grains in pills, and as clyster. Dr.
Mantegazza has used Coca with most excellent results
in dyspepsia, gastralgia, and enteralgia; he employed it
not less frequently in cases of great debility following
typhus fever, scurvy, anæmic conditions, &amp;c., and in
hysteria and hypochondriasis, even if the latter had
increased to weariness of life. The Coca might also be
employed with great benefit in mental diseases where
some physicians prescribe opium. Of its sedative effect
in spinal irritation, idiopathic convulsions, nervous
erethism, the author has fully convinced himself. He
proposes its use in the highest dose in cases of hydrophobia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and tetanus. It is a popular opinion that the
Coca is a reliable aphrodisiac; the author has, however,
observed only two cases in which a decided influence
upon the sexual system was perceived.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Mantegazza, finally, recommends this remarkable
plant, which could be easily introduced into trade, to
the profession for further physiological and therapeutical
experiments, and adds the full history of eighteen cases
by which the medicinal virtues of the remedy are proved
to satisfaction.’</p>

<p><i>Erythroxylon Coca</i>, Lam. Syn. <i>Khoka</i>, Aymara; <i>Cuca</i>,
Peruvian; <i>Coca</i>, Spanish; <i>Ypadú or Ipadú</i>, Tupin
(Brazilian).</p>
</div>


<p>By recent botanical authorities, the genus Erythroxylon
is classed in the natural order <i>Linacæ</i>, tribe <i>Erythroxyleæ</i>.
The genus contains a number of tropical
plants growing principally in South America, the West
India Islands, Madagascar, Mauritius, and some in
India and Ceylon. The folding of the leaf in its vernation,
which causes the peculiar marked line on each
side of the midrib, is characteristic of many of the
species. One has large leaves eight or nine inches long.
Lindley thus describes the Coca plant and genus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">ERYTHROXYLON.</p>

<p>“Calyx 5-parted, 5-angled at the base. Styles 3, distinct
from the very base, not consolidated. Cultivated
on the Andes of Peru from 2,000 to 9,000 feet above the
sea.”</p>

<p>“Erythroxylon du Pérou, <i>Erythroxylon Coca</i>. <i>Erythroxylon
foliis ovatis acutis subtrilincatis, ramulis
crebre tuberculosis.</i> ‘Encyclopèdie Méthodique Botanique,’
tome ii. Lamarck. Paris: 1786, 393.”</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
<p>“Leaves alternate, 1½ to 2 inches long, membranous,
flat, opaque, acute at both ends, the apex almost mucronate;
quite entire, dark green above, pale beneath,
3-nerved in the middle, with fine connecting veins.
Petiole 2-4 lines long, with a pair of intra-petiolary
ovate-lanceolate brown acute stipules, upon the back of
the outside of which, indeed, the petiole is articulated,
and from which the leaf readily falls away, leaving the
branches scaly with the persistent stipules. Flowers
numerous, in fascicles from the branches where the
leaves have fallen away, bracteated. Peduncles about
as long as the flower, sharply angled. Calyx 5-cleft;
segments acute. Petals alternate with the calycine
segments, oblong, concave, wavy, with a lacerated and
much plaited membrane arising from within and above
the base. Stamens 10; filaments longer than the pistil,
combined below into a rather short cylindrical tube.
Ovary oval. Styles 3, about as long as the ovary.
Stigmas thickened. Fruit a 1-seeded, oblong drupe, in
a dry state obscurely furrowed. Nut of the same shape
and furrowed. A powerful stimulant of the nervous
system, affecting it in a manner analogous to opium.
Less violent in its effects than that drug, but more
permanent in its action.”</p>

<p>3. Flower (enlarged).</p>

<p>4. Fruit.</p>

<p>The leaves vary much in shape on the same plant
even, the upper and lower are different, and, probably
owing to much cultivation and numerous varieties, the
dried leaves in commerce are very variable in size and
appearance, shape and colour, as well as state of preservation.
They are usually one to two inches long, but
large varieties are often four or five inches long. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
are oval oblong, but some are ovate, while others are
obovate, entire on the margin, sometimes acuminate, but
usually blunt and emarginate, and often with an apiculus
in the notch at the apex; rather thin, smooth, with a
prominent midrib, and on each side a curved line running
from the base to the apex. The fresh leaves are
paler in colour beneath, and a bloom on the surface gives
them a dichroic appearance; in one direction the upper
surface appears yellowish green, whilst if looked at direct
it is dark green. The dried leaves have a slight odour
of tea, and a somewhat grass-like, bitter, aromatic taste;
in colour they vary from a pale bright green, changing
to a yellowish green (North Peruvian or Truxillo and
Huanuco varieties)—this is smaller, thinner, and much
broken—to a dull brownish olive (Bolivian variety), this
is larger, broader, and a thicker leaf, not broken, paler
in colour beneath; the inner curved lines from base to
apex are very marked on this, but only faintly on the
Truxillo variety, in some leaves hardly discernible.
These two varieties shade off into each other. The
Truxillo variety is imported principally from Salaverry,
and, according to Hesse, is the product of <i>Erythroxylon
Coca</i>, var. <i>Novo-granatense</i>, Dyer. The variety from
Southern Peru is, he says, exported <i>viâ</i> Lima, that from
Bolivia from Arica and Mollendo. Huanuco and Cusca
cocas are known in the markets as coming from provinces
adjacent to these towns, where commercial houses
have their headquarters. Some of the Coca finds its
way to Europe through Para, the port at the mouth of
the Amazon.</p>

<p>Hesse says he obtains from these South American
Cocas, 0·7 to 0·9 per cent. of alkaloids, of which the
greater part consists of crystallizable cocaine in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
broad-leaved variety, and about one-half in the narrow-leaved
or Truxiilo Coca.—P.J. 1891, 1109.</p>

<p>In selecting them, care should be taken that they have
not fermented or become fusty—they may appear of a
good green colour, yet have a mouldy taste. The leaves
are also collected from wild plants which have strayed
from cultivation. The original habitat of the Coca plant
is not known; it has been acclimatised in Java, Ceylon,
and some parts of India.</p>

<p>Burck attributes the plant cultivated in British India
to a new species—<i>Erythroxylon Bolivianum</i>, Burck—and
that cultivated in Java to a distinct variety, <i>E. Coca</i>,
var. <i>Spruceanum</i>. The Cocas from these sources, as well
as from Ceylon, have not proved satisfactory in their
yield of cocaine. According to Hesse, the alkaloids
accompanying it considerably preponderate, the base
frequently consisting principally of cinnamyl-ecgonine
methyl ester.—P.J. 1891, 760, 1109.</p>

<p>The uses of the Coca leaf in Bolivia and Peru have been
described by many travellers, who have seen it chewed,
as has been before mentioned. From two to eight or twelve
drachms or more is used daily, in conjunction with the
ashes of the quinoa plant or with lime, as a remedy for,
or preventive against, the effects of extraordinary physical
exertion, to relieve the difficulty of respiration in
ascending mountains, and to appease hunger, thirst, and
fatigue. The leaves contain the crystalline alkaloid,
Cocaine (See page 54). They are said to be most
active when freshly dried, and are much used by the native
Indians, miners, travellers, and others. The benumbing
effect on the tongue—dulling its sensibility—I find is
much greater on chewing a fresh living leaf than that
produced by a number of dried leaves. “The average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
duration,” says Markham,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> “of Coca in a sound state
on the coast is about five months, after which time it is
said to lose flavour, and is rejected by the Indians as
worthless.” It cannot be kept in stock for any length of
time without suffering deterioration, unless it be either
stored in air-tight cases in a cool and perfectly dry
place, or kept in its original compressed packages; like
hops detached from the “pocket,” it is said to lose its
aroma. “The Peruvians,”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> says Pöppig, “are of opinion
that too much heat deprives even the best Coca of the
active principle, that a warm climate will spoil the
‘Coca del Dia’ (that dried in one day) in ten months,
whilst it continues good for a year and a half in the cold
and dry districts of the Andes.”</p>

<small>COCA IN COMMERCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Hon. Richard Gibbs, U.S. minister to Bolivia, for
some years resident at La Paz, gives a similar account
to that of Weddell of the cultivation of Coca at the
present day.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He says the consumers of Coca, both
in Peru and in Bolivia, are the native races; the whites
seldom use it, except as an infusion, and then the first
water is thrown away as being too strong. The
habitual consumers of it know nothing of toothache,
and have their teeth in good condition to a great age.
The Peruvian Government, he states, records and taxes a
production of over 15,000,000 lbs., and the Bolivian
Government about 7,000,000 lbs. annually; of the latter
about 55 per cent. is consumed in Bolivia; the Argentine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Republic and Chili about 15 per cent. each; Peru, 10
per cent.; while about 5 per cent. is exported to Europe
and the United States. As “Coca is very easily
damaged by the combined effects of heat and moisture,
it is, therefore, always stored in dry, cool warehouses,
and rarely handled or transported in damp weather or
during the rainy season. The rainy season is from
January to April, and, therefore, that stored on the west
side of the coast range is alone available for export
during the rainy season. When exported it is said that
it usually starts in very good condition, and will reach
its destination in the same condition if carried in a cool,
dry place. Such transportation is always stipulated for on
bills of lading, but the proper precautions are generally
neglected, and hence the worthless condition in which it
is often seen.”</p>

<p>Of the Coca imported into London, Liverpool, Havre,
and Hamburg, some comes in tin-lined cases containing
two tambores, but most of the large leaves (Bolivian
variety) still arrive in rough canvas bales, generally
lined with waterproof tarpaulin, and weighing from 120
to 150 lbs. each, two of which form a load for a mule for
transportation through mountain passes or across the
Andes for exportation. The bales usually contain three,
or sometimes only two, tightly packed tambores, each
weighing about 40 or 45 lbs. These latter have a canvas
covering over a banana leaf lining. Other bales contain
from six to nine smaller packages of about 16 to 20 lbs.
each, wrapped round with a coarse woollen fabric and
large dock-like leaves. The small leaves (North Peruvian)
are usually either in closely-packed bales, containing
2 or 3 hundredweights, covered with canvas, then
with tarpaulin, and again with canvas, or else in loosely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
packed canvas “beds” about 6 feet square by 1½ to 2
feet thick, containing brick-shaped packages, wrapped
in pieces of banana leaf, weighing from 1 to 3 lbs. each,
and measuring about 5 inches by 5 inches, and from 12
to 18 inches in length. The larger leaves at times arrive
in bales containing similar packages.</p>

<p>Cowley (quoted p. 9) seems to have been gifted with
second sight, and referred to the commerce of the present
day; until a few years ago it was quite unknown in the
London drug market: even yet no reliable statistics of
our imports are obtainable.</p>

<small>USE OF COCA AS A RESTORATIVE AND
BEVERAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the scepticism expressed in
Weddell’s last sentence quoted (p. 23), and his attributing
much of the effects said to be produced by Coca on the
Indians to the force of habit, Markham (<i>Op. cit.</i>) regards
it as the least injurious and the most soothing and invigorating
of all the narcotics used by man, and Dr.
Archibald Smith (“Peru as it is,” London: 1839) states,
that Coca, when fresh and good, and used in moderate
quantity, increases nervous energy, removes drowsiness,
enlivens the spirits, and enables the Indian to bear cold,
wet, great bodily exertion, and even want of food, to a
surprising degree, with apparent ease and impunity;
though it is said, if taken to excess, to occasion tremor
in the limbs, and even a gloomy sort of mania. Such
dire effects, he considers, must be of rare occurrence,
since, after living for years in constant intercourse with
persons accustomed to frequent Coca plantations, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
with Indian <i>yanacones</i> or labourers, all of whom, whether
old or young, masticated the favourite leaf, he never
witnessed a single instance in which the chewer was
affected with mania or tremor.</p>

<p>Whether, in Europe, it will ever share the field of
favour with tea, coffee, and cocoa, and become a common
beverage, is doubtful. It certainly is worthy of the
attention of students who have a tendency to become
drowsy. An infusion, 1 in 50 of distilled water, has a
bitterish grass-like taste—much the same flavour as the
selected tea supplied at the Chinese kiosk during the
Fisheries Exhibition, 1884. It may be taken after meals
as a refresher; it is not unpalatable; if sweetened, with
milk or a slice of lemon added, or infused with tea, it may
be taken as an ordinary cup of tea. The writer finds
that a teacupful, taken hot, produces a slight diaphoretic
action, quickened circulation, slight fulness in the head,
buoyancy of spirits, and wakefulness; on one occasion,
taken late, this was succeeded by rather restless sleep.
It produces more cerebral action than tea or coffee.
Johnson, in his “Chemistry of Common Life,” says we
may dismiss those fears of the Coca leaf which old
Spanish prejudices awakened, and which representations
like those of Pöppig have tended to perpetuate in
Europe. There is no good reason why it should not be
tried among ourselves. That Coca dilated the pupils of
the eye was noticed by Von Tschudi. He says, “After
partaking of a strong infusion of Coca, or the mastication
of a great quantity of it, the eye seems unable to
bear light, and there is a marked distension of the pupil,
and, when taken to the utmost excess, it never, like
opium, causes a total alienation of the mental powers, or
induces sleep; but, like opium, it excites the sensibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
of the brain, and the repeated excitement occasioned by
its intemperate use after a series of years wears out
mental vigour and activity.”</p>

<p>Weddell and others, from the sleeplessness induced
by an infusion of Coca, thought that it might contain
Theine, but neither he nor Professor Frémy were able
to isolate it, although he held that an active bitter
principle, which it had not been possible for them to
obtain in crystals, was contained in the leaves. The
isolation, since, of Cocaine, an alkaloid possessing such
curious properties, and the accounts of the use of Coca
just narrated, show that the effects attributed to it
are more than imagination and the “force of habit.”
Whether it does more than deceive or lull hunger, thirst,
and fatigue, and how it acts in these respects, are
subjects still to be investigated. The effect which
travellers have noticed it has on the respiration at high
elevations cannot be imaginary. Under the influence
of Coca, it has been said, it appears that a new force
gradually introduces itself into our organism, as water
into a sponge. Gubler thinks that as with tea, caffeine,
and theobromine, Coca brings to the nervous system the
strength with which it is charged in the manner of a
<i>fulminate</i>, with the difference, that it only yields it
slowly, not all at once.</p>

<small>PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Elixir Cocæ.</b>—1 in 6 of Simple Elixir.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—1 to 4 drachms in water is a palatable preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p><b>Extractum Cocæ Liquidum</b> (<i>Off.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Syn.</i>—<span class="smcap">Extractum Erythroxyli Fluidum</span>, U.S.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—½ to 2 drachms.</p>

<p>Coca leaves are exhausted by percolation with proof
spirit, the second part of percolate concentrated and
dissolved in the first portion, and the strength adjusted
so that 1 ounce=1 of leaves; this preparation contains all
the properties of the leaf. If freed from the coca wax it is
miscible with water and more palatable, and, so purified,
if added to port, sherry, or burgundy, in the proportion
of half a teaspoonful to a wineglassful (about an ounce to
a bottle), it forms an exhilarating mental stimulant.</p>

<p>By distilling off the spirit and concentrating by evaporation,
a solid semi-alcoholic preparation is obtained
about four times the strength of the above, known as:—</p>


<p><b>Extractum Cocæ.</b></p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—2 to 15 grains or more, in pills or pastils.</p>


<p><b>Infusum Cocæ.</b>—1 in 50 of boiling water.</p>

<p>Taken hot like tea with milk and sugar, or with a
slice of lemon, it forms a refreshing beverage. In
tonsillitis it may be used warm as a gargle.</p>


<p><b>Pastillus Cocæ Extracti, Coca Pastils.</b>—2½ grains of
the extract in each.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—One every two or three hours.</p>

<p>Coca pastils are good; cocaine cured case of asthma
of 15 years’ standing; recommended for hay fever, spasmodic
asthma, and post-nasal catarrh.—M.P.C.

<p><b>Vinum Cocæ.</b>—About 1 in 8 of Sherry.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—One to two tablespoonfuls, diluted with wine
or water.</p>

<p>This is strongly medicated, it must contain half a grain
of alkaloid in the ounce, else it cannot be sold without a
license.</p>


<p><b>Coca Wine</b> in a more palatable and popular form,
about 1 in 20 or 30 of a sweet red wine, is also prepared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and in doses of a wineglassful it forms an agreeable, exhilarating

<small>MEDICAL USES AND REFERENCES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Coca has been praised as a nervine and muscular tonic,
preventing waste of tissue, appeasing hunger and thirst,
relieving fatigue, and aiding free respiration, and as being
useful in various diseases of the digestive and respiratory
organs. It is said to be specially useful in many forms
of asthma, chronic bronchitis, obstinate cough, phthisis,
and general debility; in gastric derangements, owing to
its slight astringency, it seems to give more tone to the
stomach than the mere anæsthetic action of the Cocaine
it contains would produce locally; it is recommended
for indigestion, gastralgia, gastrodynia, nausea, sickness,
distaste for food, is given to relieve pain, nausea,
vomiting, or discomfort caused by excess in either eating
or drinking or by pregnancy, and as a cure for morphine
and alcohol craving. In using it for this in America it
is said in some cases to have produced “Coca Craving.”</p>

<p>Coca is also said to cause mental exhilaration, to overcome
diffidence or bashfulness in company, and to be an
excitant of the vital functions. It has been used in
melancholia, in cases of inordinate hunger or thirst,
such as occur in some forms of diabetes, and in cases of
generative debility. Locally, a solution of the extract in
water has been used as a pigment in irritated, inflamed,
and granular conditions of the larynx and pharynx.</p>

<p>The pastils have been used similarly for loss of voice
due to weakness or relaxation of the vocal cords.
Topically these preparations act as astringent sedatives
without deranging the stomach. Externally, Coca may
be made into poultices, or a plaster made with the extract
combined with resin or soap plaster may be applied for
rheumatism, lumbago, &amp;c. The leaves are sometimes
smoked to relieve asthma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The leaves are chewed to appease hunger and support
strength, in the absence of food, and used generally for
the stimulant and narcotic effects of tobacco and alcohol.—Pr.
xvi. 467.</p>

<p>Coca-leaves as an inhalation, or smoked in a pipe,
have a decided effect on bronchial spasm.—L. i./76,520.</p>

<p>Is of use to steady the nerves of excitable persons—to
a sportsman in shooting, for example; to give
endurance, is used by travellers in Bolivia and Peru, and
to counteract the effect of rarefied air on mountains.—L.
ii./76,449.</p>

<p>Historical and botanical account of the plant and its
uses; the result of a series of experiments on its use
was most unsatisfactory, although the drug was given in
every variety of ways, under all circumstances, and at all
hours of the day.—L. i./76,631,664.</p>

<p>Two ascents of Ben Voirlich, under the influence of,
respectively, 60 and 90 grains, done with ease by Sir
Robert Christison. By the use of Coca, hunger and
thirst are suspended, but eventually appetite and digestion
are unaffected; the mental faculties are not affected
after great bodily fatigue, except by freeing them
from dulness and drowsiness.—B.M.J. i./76,527; P.J.
1876,883.</p>

<p>Twelve athletes, during a game, chewed, without lime
or ashes, from 60 to 90 grains; at first in some, dryness
was felt, and relieved by washing the mouth; then
followed a feeling of invigoration, so that fatigue was
wholly or in great part resisted; the pulse increased in
frequency, and perspiration augmented. Save exhilaration
of spirits, no mental effects were noticed or disagreeable
effects realised.—P.J. 1877,221.</p>

<p>A party climbing Mont Blanc, each chewing 80 grains
of Coca during ten hours, were much relieved from
thirst by its use. They drank no water, tea, or coffee,
and but a limited amount of wine, yet Coca enabled
them to make the trip with comparative comfort.—M.T.G.
ii./82,165.</p>

<p>It enables a greater amount of fatigue to be borne
with less nourishment, and lessens the difficulty of respiration
in ascending mountain sides. Tea made from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
it has much the taste of green tea, and is much more
effectual in keeping people awake.—Markham’s Peruvian
Bark, p. 152.</p>

<p>In France, Bouchardat states it has rendered most
valuable therapeutic service, almost equal to cinchona
bark. It is a stimulant to the nervous and muscular
systems, and ranks with tea and coffee; it prevents the
rapid waste of tissue, and enables the consumer to go a
long time without food.—B.M.J. i./76,486.</p>

<p>Use in walking feats.—B.M.J. i./76,335,361,387,518,519,750,752.</p>

<p>The leaves are neither nutritive nor tonic; it is in their
anæsthetic properties, developed by chewing the leaves
with lime or plant ash, the Indian finds the numbing
effect on the mucous membrane of the stomach that he
seeks.—P.J. 1885,266.</p>

<p>Fluid extract of Coca relieved hæmorrhage from bowel
when given internally.—Pr. xxxv.401. And gives great
relief in gastralgia.—M.P.C. ii./87,479.</p>

<small>COCAINE AND ITS SALTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><b>COCAINA</b>, Cocaine.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—¹⁄₂₀ to 1 grain, in a pill or tablet.</p>

<p>This now important alkaloid, obtained from Coca,
was first isolated by Niemann in 1860. From analysis
he gave it the formula of C₃₂H₂₀NO₈ (old notation), but
Lossen in 1862 assigned it the now accepted formula of
C₁₇H₂₁NO₄₁ (new notation). It crystallizes in shining
monoclinic prisms, and requires 700 or more parts of
water to dissolve it; according to Dr. Paul, it takes
upwards of 1,300 parts; it dissolves more readily
in hot water, but rapidly undergoes decomposition,
forming an acid solution which contains benzoyl-ecgonine,
ecgonine, and benzoate of cocaine, which do
not separate upon cooling. It is also soluble in
alcohol (about 1 in 20), freely so in chloroform, ether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
(about 1 in 3), oil of cloves, and many other volatile
oils, and 1 in 10 respectively of melted vaseline, castor
oil, and other fixed oils. The latter solutions have proved
serviceable in eye cases. The following are also ready
solvents, each taking up about 1 of it in 3 parts: benzol,
toluol, and amylic alcohol; of petroleum spirit about 25
parts are required, much less if hot; from this solution,
also from hot alcohol, wood spirit, acetone and chloroform
it readily crystallizes on cooling. It is almost tasteless,
but produces a tingling numbness on the tongue,
and local anæsthetic action on all mucous membrane.
Good Coca leaves yield 0.5 per cent. or more of Cocaine,
but the average is less—if fermented, often <i>nil</i>. Cocaine
seems to be very sensitive to chemical and physical
action, and readily yields derivatives. In working the
dried leaves the following compounds are also met with,
Hygrine (a volatile alkaloid), Benzoyl-Ecgonine and
Ecgonine, Cocamine and Cocaidine, accompanied by
Coca-tannin and Coca-wax. All the Coca alkaloids, according
to Hesse,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> are derived from ecgonine methyl
ester, and the ecgonine itself from pyridine. Cocaine
is the most important, whilst the others, so far as is
known, do not appear to be distinctly noxious, but at
the same time they are inferior to Cocaine in anæsthetic
properties. Ecgonine (together with benzoic acid and
methyl alcohol) may also be obtained as a derivative from
Cocaine when the latter is heated with hydrochloric acid,
thus:—</p>

<p>Dr. W. Merck, by operation with hydrochloric acid on
benzoyl-ecgonine, a by-product obtained in the manufacture
of, and probably a derivative from Cocaine, converted
this into benzoic acid and ecgonine, thus:—</p>

</table>


<p>With this substance also, he, as well as Skraup, has
made Cocaine synthetically by heating in a tube to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
100° C., a mixture of benzoyl-ecgonine, iodide of methyl,
and methyl alcohol; the excess of the two latter is driven
off by heat and the Cocaine extracted as a syrupy hydriodate;
from the salt is produced pure Cocaine, melting at
98° C. and answering all other tests. (Ber. D. Chem.
Ges. 1885, 2264.) Dr. Merck has also made the synthesis
from anhydrous ecgonine by combining it with
benzoic acid and iodide of methyl.—<i>Ib.</i> 2952.</p>

<p>As atropine can be saponified by the action of alkalies
into tropic acid and tropine, and as Cocaine and atropine
act on the eye as mydriatics, Dr. Einhorn has
demonstrated their chemical relationship by converting
anhydrous ecgonine into tropidine (the anhydride of
tropine), from which it only differs in containing the
carboxyl group in place of an atom of hydrogen.</p>

<p>On combining Cocaine with benzoic acid, benzoyl-ecgonine
appears to be formed—the aqueous solution of
these is not precipitated by ammonia.</p>

<p>Cocaine is prepared by treating powdered coca leaves
with a solution of carbonate of sodium, drying the mixture
and exhausting it with petroleum spirit. The latter,
which dissolves the cocaine with very little colouring
matter, is agitated with very dilute hydrochloric acid,
the petroleum is decanted and the cocaine precipitated
from the aqueous solution by adding carbonate of sodium
again. The precipitate is separated by shaking with
ether, which on evaporation yields crystals of almost
pure Cocaine. Most of the Cocaine now used is manufactured
in a crude form in Lima, and imported from
Callao. It yields about 85 per cent. of pure alkaloid,
and is recrystallized or converted into the hydrochlorate
after its arrival in Europe.</p>

<p>No coloration is produced by dissolving pure Cocaine
or its hydrochlorate in cold concentrated sulphuric acid;
with the salt, effervescence occurs, owing to hydrochloric
acid gas being set free. Some samples give a faint
evanescent yellow coloration, and others give a magenta
tinge which gradually passes to a brownish yellow, and
eventually the solution becomes almost colourless.</p>

<p>If Cocaine or a salt be moistened with nitric acid, evaporated
to dryness, and a drop of alcoholic caustic potash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
added, a characteristic peppermint odour is developed.—P.J.
1890, 162.</p>

<p>Report on action of ecgonine, benzoyl-ecgonine, and
cocamine.—Th. Gaz. Oct. 1889, 698.</p>

<p>As pure Cocaine (the alkaloid) is soluble in fats and
oils, and its salts are not, it should always be used when
it has to be combined with fatty or oily substances, for
use externally, <i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1"><b>Bougies of Cocaine.</b> ½ grain each or more, with
cacao-butter.</p>

<p>Are useful in painful affections of the urethra.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Ceratum Cocainæ.</b> 1 in 30 of petroleum cerate.</p>

<p>Is useful in burns, scalds, urticaria, pruritus, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Collodium Cocainæ.</b> 2 per cent. in flexible collodion.</p>

<p>Allays the itching, and is a cure for inflamed chilblains.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Emplastrum Cocainæ.</b> 1 dissolved in 50 of lead plaster
heated in a water bath.</p>
</div>

<p>Useful for intercostal neuralgia, sciatica, tender corns,
bruises, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Oleatum Cocainæ.</b></p>

<p>A saturated solution of the alkaloid in oleic acid;
heated, one part will dissolve in two parts of oleic acid;
it may be further diluted with oleic acid or oil. Has
not proved so satisfactory a preparation as</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Oleum cum Cocaina.</b></p>

<p>A 2 per cent. solution, more or less, if ordered, in
almond oil, is mostly used. This is useful for earache.

for catheters, a solution in equal parts castor and almond
oils does well, it is viscid, and does not congeal in winter.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Suppositories</b> and <b>Pessaries of Cocaine</b> have ½ grain
(or more, if ordered) in each with cacao-butter.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Tabellæ Cocainæ</b>, Cocaine Tablets. ¹⁄₂₀ grain in each,
with chocolate (or more, if ordered).</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—1 every quarter, half-hour, or hour, quickly
eaten and swallowed. Useful for sea-sickness, chloroform
or alcohol sickness, sickness of pregnancy, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>


<p class="p1"><b>Unguentum Cocainæ.</b> 1 in 30 of lard or lanoline (more
or less, if ordered). Cocaine is soluble 1 in 2 of
anhydrous lanoline if gently warmed.</p>


<p>Useful where absorption is required, as in facial
neuralgia, shingles, eczema, erysipelas, urticaria, and
pruritus.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Vaselinum Cocainæ.</b> 4 per cent. (more or less, if
ordered).</p>


<p>Suitable for the eye; is very bland; also for smearing
catheters, burns, scalds, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Cocainæ Citras</b>, Citrate of Cocaine.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—¹⁄₂₀ to 1 grain or more.</p>

<p>Is in deliquescent small white crystals; used by
dentists.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Cocainæ Hydrobromas</b>, Hydrobromate of Cocaine.</p>

<p><i>Dose.</i>—¹⁄₂₀ to 1 grain, in a pill or solution. Is a stable
salt, in odourless, small, white, hard, acicular crystals.</p>


<p class="p1"><b>Cocainæ Hydrochloras</b>, Hydrochlorate of Cocaine (<i>Off.</i>).</p>


<p><i>Off. Dose.</i>—⅕ to 1 grain, but less and more may be
given, in aqueous solution, pill, or pastil.</p>

<p>This salt has been most used: if pure it is in hard,
colourless, short, acicular, granular-looking crystals, or,
now more frequently met with, in light, shining, lamellar
crystals, free from odour and almost tasteless; being
soluble in half its weight of water, the tingling numbness
and local anæsthesia which it produces on the tongue
are more intense than that produced by pure cocaine.</p>

<p>Freely soluble in spirit and in glycerine, insoluble in
ether, fats, and oils, and therefore it is not so compatible
with them. This salt will crystallize with two molecules
(9·5 per cent.) of water, but the anhydrous salt alone is
official. It dissolves with effervescence but without
colour in cold sulphuric acid (<i>see</i> Cocaine, p. 56), but
chars if heated. Ignited in the air, it burns without
residue. Its aqueous solution gives a white precipitate
with carbonate of ammonium, soluble in excess. If one
drop of solution of permanganate of potassium, B.P.,
be added to a solution of 1 grain of it in a drachm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
distilled water, acidulated with three drops of diluted
sulphuric acid, the bright deep colour of the solution, if
kept covered, should not change during half an hour,
indicating absence of other alkaloids of Coca, or any
other organic matter. The salt should not only be in
good crystals, but should yield a distinctly crystalline
precipitate of pure cocaine within three minutes, when
1 grain of it is dissolved in 2 ounces of distilled water,
and six to eight drops of solution of ammonia, B.P., are
added and well stirred. The precipitate redissolves
after twenty-four hours or more, the cocaine being converted
into methyl alcohol and benzoyl-ecgonine.—P.J.
1888, 783. If a trace be mixed with a minute quantity
of calomel and breathed upon, the mixture assumes a
black colour. This will only answer with the salts of
cocaine, not with the alkaloid itself.</p>

<p>As with an aqueous solution of sulphate of atropine,
so with an aqueous solution of hydrochlorate of cocaine,
some samples seem prone to grow fungi, while others
will not. Evil results having followed the application of
Cocaine as a local anæsthetic in several dental and eye
operations, the bad effects have been attributed to these
fungoid growths. Whether due to these, to impurity of
the salt, or to the condition or idiosyncrasy of the patient,
is not clear. Three London surgeons who have used it
very largely inform me they have never seen any untoward
results from its use in simple aqueous solution.
Various modes of keeping the solution free from fungi
have been suggested; carbolic, boric, and benzoic acids,
perchloride of mercury, thymol, camphor, and chloroform
have been added to check their growth; a half to
one per cent. of boric acid has been particularly recommended,
but it is of little use, as an aqueous solution of
boric acid itself sometimes grows a fungus; chloroform
is probably unobjectionable except for eye drops. Perchloride
of mercury is useless, as it forms a double salt
with the Cocaine. But salicylic acid has been found to
be the most effective, and its addition is now ordered in
the official solution. (See p. 60.)</p>

<small>USES OF COCAINE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The curious property cocaine possesses of producing
local anæsthesia was even noted by the discoverer of
the alkaloid—Niemann, who, so far back as 1860, wrote:
“It produces temporary insensibility on the part of the
tongue with which it comes in contact” (Watts’s Dict.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
1st Edition, i. 1059, <i>ex</i> “Ann. Ch. Pharm.” cxiv. 215). This
interesting fact lay dormant until in 1884, Herr Koller, a
medical student in Vienna, was led to test the local
anæsthetic action of the hydrochlorate of the alkaloid,
on account of the effect he had witnessed when cocaine
in solution was pencilled upon the pharynx to render it
less susceptible in laryngoscopic examination. A vial
of the solution was given by Herr Koller to Dr.
Brettauer, of Trieste, who, on Sept. 15th, 1884, demonstrated
its properties at the meeting of the Ophthalmological
Congress in Heidelberg. Several experiments
were made with the two per cent. solution, which showed
that when two drops of the liquid were placed upon the
surface of the normal cornea, and the application repeated
after an interval of ten minutes, at the end of ten
minutes more, the sensibility of the cornea was so far
diminished that it could be pressed with a probe; the
cornea and the surface of the eyeball and eyelids adjoining
could be rubbed; a speculum could be inserted and
the lids widely separated, the conjunctiva could even be
seized with fixation forceps, and the eye moved in
various directions without causing the patient notable
discomfort.</p>

<p>Besides rendering the superficial structures of the eye
anæsthetic, it is a mydriatic, and produces paralysis of
the accommodation, which passes off sooner than the
dilatation of the pupil; this does not at longest last more
than twelve hours. The sensitiveness of the iris is less
affected than that of the surface of the eye. The great
excellence of cocaine consists in the limitation of its
action to the tissues to which it is applied. No doubt,
other symptoms at a distance do result from the external
application of the anæsthetic, but they are, for the most
part, insignificant and free from dangerous consequences.
In some measure cocaine may be compared with curare.
The one agent paralyses the termination of the sensory
nerves, whilst the other paralyses the termination of the
motor nerves. Cocaine would seem to act in a manner
the reverse of aconite. When applied to a mucous
membrane, it has probably a constricting action on the
vessels, produces a blanching of the part, and simultaneously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
a deadening of the nervous excitability which
passes into a complete state of anæsthesia; its effect,
however, does not sink deeply into the adjacent tissues,
nor does it last long. This surface application is
sufficient to render painless the use of a caustic, the
passage of catheters and lithotrites, or the performance
of operations which do not involve the more deeply-seated
tissues. Such operations as the opening of
abscesses and buboes, the removal of small tumours,
require the surface anæsthesia to be supplemented by
two or more hypodermic injections, of a quarter of a
grain in each, of the hydrochlorate in close contiguity
to the part to be operated on. Injected hypodermically,
the aqueous solutions of its salts deaden sensibility around
the puncture, so that the deep prick of a pin is not felt—the
surrounding part is reddened, but after thirty
minutes it resumes its normal condition; injected
locally, is more useful than morphine in relieving sciatica.
Although solutions of it are little absorbed by the skin—even
a chloroform solution is scarcely at all absorbed—yet
the application of an ointment of the pure alkaloid,
made with lard, or an oily solution of it, to a surface
will remove the pain of inflammation, as in eczema or
erysipelas, or the pain of facial neuralgia or shingles,
and the irritation of urticaria or pruritus. Burns and
scalds should first be brushed over with a 4 per cent.
aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate, and the pure
alkaloid combined with carron oil (Linimentum Calcis),
petroleum cerate, or boric acid ointment, afterwards
applied on cotton wool or lint. Combined with boric
acid ointment, also, it may be used for fissured nipples,
or for these and stings and bites of insects an aqueous
solution may be applied. The irritability of inflamed
mucous surfaces, as in hay-fever, influenza, coryza,
bronchitis, spasmodic asthma, laryngitis, and pharyngitis,
is much relieved by the spray of a watery solution of a
cocaine salt. In obstetrics, its local application relieves
the pain of the dilating os uteri, and diminishes the
sensibility of the perinæum whilst being dilated in first
labours; rents of the perinæum may be stitched up
almost painlessly under its action, and under its influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
many minor gynæcological operations are much facilitated
by the ability to insert needles and make small
incisions without pain. The spasmodic and painful affections
of the vagina, causing dyspareunia and vaginismus,
may be minimised by vaginal injections of a quarter of
a grain of cocaine in 1 per cent. oily solutions. In
dentistry, it is useful in toothache; it deadens the
sensibility of exposed pulp. The pure alkaloid is preferable
to the salts for this purpose, because, being only
slightly soluble in water, it is less liable to be washed
away by the saliva. If a little be inserted in the cavity
of a carious tooth and covered with a plug of mastic
solution, all pain is obtunded for a considerable time.
A strong solution in oil of cloves is also useful. In preparing
the cavity, previous to filling, the sensitiveness of
the dentine is more effectively treated by using a salt of
cocaine—either the hydrochlorate or citrate; the latter
has been recommended, as it can be formed into a pellet
with the fingers and pressed into the cavity, but it is not
so rich in true alkaloid as the hydrochlorate; yet, either
of these is absorbed more quickly than the alkaloid itself,
which, as before said, is more suitable for plugging a
cavity for some length of time. Before using arsenical
paste to destroy the nerve when exposed, if about a
quarter of a grain of a cocaine salt be inserted into the
cavity, after partially clearing, it will anæsthetize the
pulp in about five minutes, and enable the operator
thoroughly to open the cavity and expose the pulp
directly to the action of the arsenical paste without pain
to the patient. In extraction, if a dose be hypodermically
injected into the gum on each side at the base of the
tooth, after waiting about five minutes this may be done
almost painlessly, and, if a 50 per cent. aqueous solution
of the hydrochlorate be painted on the surrounding gum,
the first pain of inserting the forceps is annulled. The
eye, ear, throat, mouth, tongue, pharynx, nose, larynx,
trachea, urethra, vagina, os uteri, anus, rectum, and, in
fact, the whole mucous membrane, as well as cut surfaces
and open sores, are affected by it, but the true skin is
less so.</p>

<p>Solutions of hydrochlorate of cocaine have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
employed topically in excision of the tonsils, cauterizing
the turbinated tissue of the nose, painting chancres
previous to the application of nitric acid or other caustics,
opening abscesses, removing polypi, and many cases of
iridectomy and operation for cataract, squint, and the
removal of foreign bodies from the eye. For the eye an
aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate of cocaine of
mostly 2, but sometimes 4, per cent. is used, and for
other purposes from 4 to 20 or even 50 per cent.; of the
weaker solutions it is necessary to repeat the application
three to five times, at intervals of three to five minutes.
No operation should be commenced within at least ten
minutes of the first application. Injurious effects, either
local or constitutional, rarely follow its use. Its action
commences in three minutes, increases from ten to
twenty minutes, and mostly disappears within half an
hour. The anæsthesia may be prolonged by applying
an Esmarch’s bandage round the site of injection.</p>

<p><i>Uses of Cocaine, and cautions on its employment; a
summary of the experiences of fifty-two surgeons in the
United States.</i> In minor surgery—is of value in all
operations where circulation can be temporarily arrested
in order to prevent undue absorption. A fresh solution
should be employed, of strength not exceeding 4 per
cent. Caution is required when the circulation cannot
be controlled. Is of little use as a local anæsthetic in
anal work, such as fistula. In genito-urinary surgery
must be used with care, as it is in this class of cases that
untoward effects have been most marked; the solution
should not remain in contact with mucous surface more
than a few moments. In gynæcological work it is of
limited service, as general anæsthesia is mostly to be
preferred. For ophthalmic surgery, Cocaine is the
anæsthetic <i>par excellence</i>; in no other department of
surgery is its use so widespread and its application so
entirely satisfactory. It is suitable for all operations on
the eyeball, except iridectomy for acute glaucoma, and
enucleation; as it causes dryness of the epithelium it
should not be used long prior to operation. Is of great
value in nasal, aural, and throat operations.—Th. Gaz.
Aug. 1891, 518.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p><b>Chloroform and Cocaine Anæsthesia</b> (<i>combined</i>).—Chloroform
is given, 1 to 3 drachms, with an Esmarch’s
mask, and from ½ to ¾ grain of cocaine, in 3 to 5 per
cent. solution, injected into the part. Less chloroform
suffices, vomiting is rare, and depression on waking
slighter than chloroform alone produces.—L ii./88,220;
B.M.J. ii/88,903. Th. Gaz. Sept. 1888, 630; Oct. 686;
Dec. 849.</p>

<p>Equal parts of an 8 per cent. solution and liquor atropinæ
sulphatis form an effective remedy for all painful
and inflamed conditions of the eye; and half a grain of
pilocarpine nitrate, added to 1 drachm of a 4 per cent.
solution, produces anæsthesia without in the least disturbing
the accommodation.—Whitla.</p>

<p>As regards the toxic properties of cocaine, its effects
appear to be mild and not cumulative. It causes cessation
of respiration,—small doses have an exhilarating
effect on the nerve-centres and other parts of the nervous
system. In a case of attempted suicide by an apothecary,
a dose of 1.5 grammes (23 grains) seemed to have
no seriously injurious effect.—Varge’s “Zeitschr.” v.f. 11,
5, p. 222, 1863.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>British and Colonial Druggist</i>, Feb.,
1885, p. 36, thus describes the effect of a full dose:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>“Inasmuch as the writer—whose nervous system is
of an almost unfortunate degree of sensitiveness—has
taken doses of the hydrochlorate, equivalent, in the
aggregate, to no less than 32 grains of cocaine itself
within the space of three hours, without (as the present
lines sufficiently prove) a fatal result following, this
remarkable body cannot fairly be classed among the
poisonous alkaloids. Among the chief symptoms induced
were increased cerebral activity mounting at intervals
into the region of delirium, the latter tendency always
subservient to a powerful effort of the will. This continued
for five hours, the heart action and breathing
being meanwhile slightly increased, but not to any
painful extent. At first the muscular powers appeared
to be enhanced, heavier weights being lifted without
undue stress than is ordinarily the case, while the
reflective faculties—as instanced by ability to read and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
form conclusions upon novel scientific matter—seemed
stimulated. An hour after the entire quantity named
had been taken, the sensibility of the limbs to external
influences—which had gradually diminished from the
first—became materially lowered, and neither pinches,
pricks, nor slight burns with a heated wire could be
felt upon the fleshy portions of the arms or legs. The
trunk, however, never lost its sensibility to pain in any
marked degree.</p>

<p>“Slight convulsive movements and a sensation of
bodily torpor succeeded, giving way about the eighth
hour to considerable somnolency. No special desire, or
distaste, for food was noticeable, but sleep overcame all
other symptoms between ten and eleven hours from the
commencement, and continued for thirteen hours afterwards;
a slight feeling of dizziness was experienced on
waking, but this gradually wore off, and had entirely
disappeared twenty-four hours later.”</p>
</div>

<p>By physiologists, it had been supposed that cocaine
would have properties allied to, if not identical with,
caffeine, theme, or theobromine, in the manner that
these themselves are allied. But, chemically, cocaine
is quite distinct; it is much less soluble in water than
caffeine; it is a strong base, which caffeine is not, and
its chemical constitution and derivatives are quite distinct
from those of caffeine. As a medicine, the coca leaf
has been more used in France and America than in
England.</p>

<p>Opinions are at present divided as to whether the
anæsthesia produced by Cocaine is the result of vasomotor
disturbance—the small vessels are caused to contract
by its application, and the nervous filaments are
doubtless anæmic—or whether Cocaine acts directly as
a paralyser on the nervous endings, whether of sensibility,
or touch, or of special sense, since it removes the
power of taste and smell, as well as the perception of
touch and pain. When Cocaine is administered in
such a dose and manner as to affect the whole system,
the brain seems to become excited, the heart stimulated,
and blood and pressure increased. Poisonous doses
kill by asphyxia, the breathing becoming arrested and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the heart failing in diastole; but this has not yet been
observed in man, the dose necessary to produce this
effect being very large; 20 grains have been taken
without very serious result. It diminishes all the secretions,
and, although the intestinal movements are
slightly stimulated at first, larger doses or continued
use cause sluggish action, dyspepsia, and constipation.
Tissue change is lessened, and the amount of urea is
similarly diminished; the temperature seems to be
somewhat higher than normal; albuminuria has been
found to follow its use, and sugar has been found in
the urine. The kidneys are probably the special
means of its elimination. With regard to its action on
muscular fibre nothing is known, observers being completely
at variance in their opinions.—Buxton, in Ringer’s
“Therapeutics,” 12th edition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Brown-Séquard regards the effect as a new sample of
inhibitory action, his experiments convincing him that
Cocaine acts through the medium of the peripheral
nerves on the nervous centres, which react in bringing
about inhibition of sensibility. The phenomena which
result from the injection of Cocaine at the level of the
larynx, he finds to be the same as those which are
consecutive to the application of a jet of carbonic acid
on the mucous membrane of that organ. Two minutes
after the injection there is a generalised anæsthesia and
an analgesia of the different wounds made on the body of
the animal. The cutaneous anæsthesia lasts only a few
minutes, but the analgesia of the wounds persists even
till the following day. If fresh wounds are made, these,
far from being analgesic, become, on the contrary,
hyperalgesic. That which proved that Cocaine acts on
the nervous centres, and particularly on the cerebellum,
is that injections of this substance produced sometimes
a rolling motion to the side opposite to the injection, and
at others a turning motion. Evidence of the inhibitory
action is offered by another of Brown-Séquard’s experiments:
when the dose of Cocaine injected was large
enough to produce convulsions, it was sufficient to pull or
forcibly flex the toes to immediately stop the convulsions.
In animals which died under these conditions the temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of the body after death was as high as 44°·4 C,
or 111°·6 F.”—Brown-Séquard in Prosser James’
“Guide to New B.P.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Vienna, Cocaine has been recommended for use
internally in cases of great exhaustion, such as loss of
blood, sunstroke, or diarrhœa, also by mouth or hypodermically
as a cure for morphine and alcohol craving.
Morphine and Cocaine appear to be mutually antagonistic.
Cocaine has been used in some cases of melancholia
and insomnia; it also possesses aphrodisiac
properties. It was likewise found to lessen the desire
for sleep and feeling of hunger, and to be a stimulant
which quickly increases and sustains, in a harmless
manner, the physical powers of the body, such as are
required in long marches, mountain ascents, &amp;c., in dose
of ¾ to 1½ grains.</p>

<p>Cocaine is a stomachic, useful after excess either in
eating or drinking, in distaste for food, in sea-sickness
and vomiting of pregnancy, or from other causes; it also
improves the condition of the stomach in atonic indigestion
and nervous affections of this organ, as well as in
phthisis and cachectic cases, especially those arising from
the use of mercury.</p>

<p>Useful in psoriasis of tongue, used before a meal
averts pain from passage of food; in painful affections
of stomach, affords relief and averts vomiting, as that of
pregnancy; in pruritus ani and itching skin diseases;
and as an anal injection checks diarrhœa and straining
of dysentery.—Ringer’s “Therapeutics,” 12th Edition.</p>

<p>Cocaine adopted to relieve morphine craving led to
extreme cocaine abuse.—L. ii./90,424.</p>

<p>The addition of phenol to hypodermic solution, 1 part
to 30, preserves the solution, increases anæsthetic action,
and diminishes risk of toxic symptoms following its use.
B.M.J. ii./90,94.</p>

<p>Resorcin prevents cocaine poisoning; value of both
drugs enhanced by combination.—B.M.J. ii./90,506.</p>

<p>A 2 per cent. solution recommended in preference to
stronger, as it appears to be more quickly absorbed.
An overdose usually causes quick pulse, rise of temperature,
dilatation of pupil, anorexia, and insomnia.
This last yields best to chloral, but requires large
doses.—L. ii./91,663.</p>

<p>Successful case of laparotomy under cocaine; 12
minims of 20 per cent. solution used.—B. M. J. ii./90,
1022.</p>

<p>Amputation of wrist under cocaine; no shock.—B.
M. J., Supp. i./91,202.</p>

<p>Cystitis arising from cantharides blistering not prevented
by camphor; intolerable pain, unalleviated by
morphine, attended fresh blistering, but ceased instantly
on the introduction into the prostatic urethra of 15
minims of 1 per cent. solution of cocaine hydrochlorate.
The pain recurred in three and a half hours, but yielded
at once to ten minims of the solution, and did not return.—L.
ii./91,1351.</p>

<p>Cocaine decidedly useful in sea-sickness. In crossing
Channel two ladies, usually ill, were kept free from the
horrid feeling, one by taking six and the other three, ⅒
grain doses.—Mrs. Fenwick-Miller, in Ladies’ Column,
<i>Illustrated London News</i>, August 27, 1891.</p>

develop fungoid growths. The salicylic acid remains as free acid in the
mixture, as with perchloride of iron it gives a more permanent violet
coloration than the so-called salicylate of cocaine. The official solution
may be used as an application for producing local anæsthesia or for
hypodermic injection, for which purpose it is found to be unirritating. A

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
